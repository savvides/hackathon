# Problem Bank

50 curated challenge problems at the intersection of education and healthcare, grounded in Arizona's context with global framing.

## Structure

The bank is organized into three parts:

- **Part 1: Intersection of Education & Health** (17 problems) — clinical placements, competency tracking, mental health navigation, healthcare career pipelines, health literacy
- **Part 2: Education-Only** (16 problems) — first-gen student success, transfer pathways, online engagement, faculty workload, equity gaps, microcredentials
- **Part 3: Health-Only** (17 problems) — workforce burnout, scheduling, heat vulnerability, telehealth, opioid prediction, tribal health, hospital capacity

Each problem follows a consistent format: problem statement, affected stakeholders, current inadequate solutions, Arizona-specific context, global context, ethical considerations (PI framework), and prototype scope.

Three problems are flagged as **high-difficulty differentiation challenges** designed to separate top-performing teams: #17 (diagnostic uncertainty simulator), #33 (equity gap identifier), #37 (workforce retention forecaster).

## Adaptation Notes

- The Arizona-specific data (nursing shortage projections, tribal health statistics, heat mortality data, border crossing volumes) is preserved as a worked example
- Replace regional data with your own — every problem has a "Global Context" section showing the challenge is universal
- The ethical considerations section is framework-agnostic despite referencing PI — any responsible innovation framework works
- The problem count (50) was more than needed for 25 teams — having 2x problems relative to teams gives meaningful selection
- Consider organizing problems into tracks that map to your mentor expertise areas
