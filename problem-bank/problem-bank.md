Version 2.0 \| 50 Problems \| Last Updated: January 30, 2026

The convergence of Arizona\'s healthcare workforce crisis, ASU Health\'s
launch, and rapidly evolving educational technology creates an
unprecedented opportunity for student innovation. This curated problem
bank identifies 50 specific challenges where 2.5-day prototypes can
demonstrate meaningful impact using the Principled Innovation framework.
ASU Health\'s strategic priorities---workforce development, health
equity, AI integration, and data-driven decision-making---anchor the
health-focused problems, while the existing hackathon pain points
framework structures education challenges.

**Contents**

**PART 1: INTERSECTION OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH (17 Problems)**

*These problems sit at the crossroads where educational systems and
healthcare delivery intersect---precisely where ASU Health\'s \"learning
health ecosystem\" model operates.*

**1.1 Medical and Healthcare Education Challenges**

**Problem 1: Clinical Placement Matching Crisis ⭐ ASU Health Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Nursing and medical schools turned away 91,938
qualified applicants in 2021-2022 due to insufficient clinical placement
sites. Arizona faces the nation\'s worst projected nursing
shortage---28,100 nurses short by 2025---yet hospitals are too
understaffed to train students.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nursing/medical/PA students, clinical
coordinators, hospital preceptors, patients awaiting care, healthcare
systems experiencing shortages

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Students travel farther for rotations
(averaging \$3,495 in remote housing costs), simulation replaces
hands-on time, schools pay hospitals for placements---all increasing
costs without addressing root capacity issues

**Arizona-Specific Context:** State allocated \$25 million annually for
preceptor training (HB 2691), projecting 1,145 new preceptors and 460
new nursing students. ASU Health\'s HonorHealth partnership aims to
expand clinical training capacity for the new medical school starting
2026.

**Global Context:** One in four nursing students in England leave or
suspend studies. The challenge is universal---clinical placements
comprise one-third of healthcare students\' university time across OECD
nations.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we balance expanding
training capacity against quality patient care? Who bears the cost when
students must travel---perpetuating inequity for lower-income students?

**Prototype Scope:** Real-time matching platform connecting students
with available clinical sites across Arizona, incorporating preceptor
availability, student proximity, and competency needs.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 2: Healthcare Student Competency Tracking**

**Problem Statement:** Medical education is transitioning from
time-based to competency-based models, but 80% of clinical education
occurs in inpatient settings while 80-90% of medicine is practiced
outpatient. No unified system tracks student mastery across multiple
rotation sites.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare students, clinical faculty,
licensing boards, future patients

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Paper-based evaluations, inconsistent
assessment standards across sites, competencies verified by time spent
rather than demonstrated skill

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU Health\'s John Shufeldt School of
Medicine will require dual MD/MS degrees with engineering
competencies---demanding novel assessment approaches. Only \~58% of
medical schools nationally incorporate telehealth curriculum despite its
importance in rural Arizona.

**Global Context:** WHO endorses competency-based education globally.
Countries like Scotland have implemented e-portfolios for continuous
competency tracking across rotations.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we ensure assessment
tools don\'t inadvertently disadvantage students from certain
backgrounds? What transparency do patients deserve about trainee
competencies?

**Prototype Scope:** Unified competency dashboard tracking clinical
skills across rotation sites with self-assessment, preceptor
verification, and gap identification.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 3: Interprofessional Education Simulation ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Healthcare professionals train in silos but
practice requires team-based collaboration. Physicians, nurses, and
pharmacists rarely learn together despite treating the same patients.

**Affected Stakeholders:** All healthcare students, clinical educators,
patients experiencing care coordination failures

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Occasional interdisciplinary events,
siloed curricula, communication skills deferred until practice when
errors affect real patients

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU Health\'s curriculum explicitly
integrates \"interprofessional collaboration\" as a core theme. The
ecosystem includes nursing (Edson College), medicine (Shufeldt School),
public health technology, and health solutions---natural partners for
IPE.

**Global Context:** Simulation-based IPE shows improved teamwork and
reduced medical errors in Canadian and UK studies. WHO identifies IPE as
essential for meeting health workforce challenges.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we ensure power
dynamics between professions are addressed rather than reinforced? How
do we balance efficiency with building genuine collaborative
relationships?

**Prototype Scope:** Virtual case-based simulation where nursing,
medical, and pharmacy students collaborate on patient scenarios, with
AI-generated feedback on communication patterns.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 4: Nursing Faculty Recruitment Platform**

**Problem Statement:** 2,166 full-time nursing faculty vacancies exist
across 909 nursing schools, with 84% requiring doctoral degrees. The
\$30,000+ salary gap between teaching and clinical practice drives
nurses away from academia, creating a bottleneck that prevents training
more nurses.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nursing schools, clinical nurses interested
in teaching, nursing students, healthcare systems needing nurses

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Schools rely heavily on
part-time/adjunct faculty, one-third of nursing faculty over age 60
approaching retirement

**Arizona-Specific Context:** 94 vacant full-time faculty positions
across 38 Arizona nursing colleges. Arizona\'s \$25 million preceptor
training investment could be leveraged for faculty pathways.

**Global Context:** Faculty shortages affect nursing education globally.
Philippines\' Nurse Education Loan Program combines loans with
coaching---a model for faculty development.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we value teaching
labor fairly? Should we ask clinical nurses to sacrifice income for
education\'s benefit?

**Prototype Scope:** Platform matching clinical nurses with part-time
teaching opportunities, highlighting hybrid roles that maintain clinical
income while building teaching experience.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**1.2 Student Wellness and Mental Health**

**Problem 5: Campus Mental Health Navigation ⭐ High Impact**

**Problem Statement:** 46% of college students have a diagnosed mental
health condition, but counseling centers can\'t meet demand---counselor
utilization grew 5x faster than enrollment. Students face 6+ week
waitlists; those waitlisted show 14% higher attrition rates.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students with mental health needs, counseling
center staff, academic advisors, families, universities experiencing
retention challenges

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Limited counseling center hours, long
waitlists, students unaware of services or deterred by stigma,
crisis-focused rather than preventive

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU was recognized in 2018 as one of seven
best U.S. colleges for wellness programming. Large commuter and online
populations (80,000+ ASU Online students) face unique isolation
challenges.

**Global Context:** The crisis is global---Dartmouth/UN research links
declining youth mental health to smartphone adoption worldwide.
Successful interventions include peer support models (Georgia Tech\'s
\"upstream\" approach) and curriculum-embedded wellness (Saint Louis
University).

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we provide support
without pathologizing normal stress? What data should be collected, and
who should see it? How do we prevent algorithmic bias in risk detection?

**Prototype Scope:** Resource navigation tool helping students identify
appropriate services based on needs---from self-help to peer support to
professional care---with waitlist engagement features.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 6: Peer Mental Health Support Matching**

**Problem Statement:** 63% of struggling students don\'t seek
professional support, but peer support is students\' #1 preferred method
for emotional support. Formal peer support programs exist but lack
effective matching systems.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students seeking support, peer counselors,
counseling centers, student affairs staff

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic peer support training, random
matching, limited follow-up, unclear escalation pathways

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU\'s scale (194,000+ students) makes
peer support essential for extending mental health reach.
First-generation students (33% of ASU undergraduates) particularly
benefit from peer connections.

**Global Context:** Peer support models show success globally in
reducing stigma and extending capacity. UK universities report improved
help-seeking when peer programs are visible.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** What boundaries should peer
supporters maintain? How do we prevent vicarious trauma in peer
counselors? When must issues be escalated?

**Prototype Scope:** Matching platform connecting students with trained
peers based on shared experiences (first-gen, major, background), with
built-in escalation protocols.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 7: Student Burnout Early Detection**

**Problem Statement:** 70% of students report struggling with mental
health since starting college, and 51% have skipped class due to mental
health. Early intervention prevents attrition, but warning signs go
undetected until crisis.

**Affected Stakeholders:** At-risk students, academic advisors, faculty,
families, retention teams

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Reactive crisis response, self-report
surveys with low response rates, faculty informally observing but
lacking systems to report concerns

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU\'s 86.6% retention rate is 1.2
percentage points below enterprise goals. Gateway course performance
often signals burnout before students seek help.

**Global Context:** Wearable AI detecting stress among students is
advancing globally. AI analysis of emotional diaries identifies
depression with \~90% accuracy in research settings.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we balance early
detection with privacy? What consent is needed for monitoring? Who
receives alerts, and how do we prevent punitive use?

**Prototype Scope:** Voluntary check-in tool analyzing engagement
patterns and self-reported indicators to surface early intervention
opportunities---with student-controlled sharing.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 8: Health Professions Student Resilience Support**

**Problem Statement:** Nursing students experience 19-46% burnout
prevalence, with 41% experiencing high emotional exhaustion. Burnout
increases through academic progression and worsens during clinical
rotations with patient contact, contributing to high attrition.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nursing/medical/health professions students,
clinical faculty, program administrators, healthcare systems losing
future workers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Wellness workshops disconnected from
curriculum, limited processing support for difficult clinical
experiences, stigma around seeking help in \"tough\" healthcare culture

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Given Arizona\'s nursing shortage, every
student who leaves due to burnout worsens the crisis. ASU Health\'s
focus on \"humanism and patient-centric care\" requires addressing
student wellbeing.

**Global Context:** Meta-analysis found nurse burnout associated with
lower patient safety, more medication errors. Saint Louis University
reduced depression, anxiety, and stress through curricular
changes---scheduling, grading, mindfulness integration.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Should students showing
burnout be counseled out of demanding programs? How do we address
systemic problems rather than just individual coping?

**Prototype Scope:** Reflection and processing tool for difficult
clinical experiences with peer discussion features and faculty check-in
prompts.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**1.3 Health Literacy and Workforce Pipeline**

**Problem 9: Health Information Credibility Checker**

**Problem Statement:** Only 23.2% of college students demonstrate
excellent health literacy. 7.3% are inadequate, and 29.8%
problematic/limited. Students struggle to evaluate online health
information quality amid \"information pollution.\"

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students making health decisions, campus
health services, public health educators, patients (long-term)

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** No systematic health literacy
curriculum in general education, reliance on students\' own evaluation
skills

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU Health explicitly includes \"Health
Literacy\" as an ecosystem component---expanding health literacy so
people make informed decisions is a core strategic priority.

**Global Context:** Research links limited health literacy to higher
stress, depression, and lower quality of life. Digital health literacy
skills increasingly critical as telehealth expands.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Who defines \"credible\"? How
do we avoid paternalism while guiding evaluation? What about legitimate
scientific uncertainty?

**Prototype Scope:** Browser extension or app evaluating health website
credibility using source analysis, checking claims against verified
databases, flagging misinformation patterns.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 10: K-12 Healthcare Career Exposure Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Racial and ethnic minorities are severely
underrepresented in healthcare. Black representation ranges from 3.3%
(physical therapists) to 11.4% (respiratory therapists) versus 12.1% of
workforce. The number of Black men in medical school hasn\'t increased
since 1978.

**Affected Stakeholders:** K-12 students from underrepresented
backgrounds, school counselors, healthcare diversity officers,
underserved communities lacking diverse providers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Career days with limited healthcare
representation, mentorship programs that can\'t reach scale, academic
pipeline programs starting too late (college)

**Arizona-Specific Context:** 58.5% of Arizona\'s rural students
identify as nonwhite. Only 22 of 100 Arizona K-12 students go on to
college; only 6 obtain bachelor\'s degrees. Early exposure critical for
diverse healthcare pipeline.

**Global Context:** Minority healthcare workers more likely to practice
in underserved communities. Diversity improves cultural competence and
reduces disparities---WHO priority globally.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we inspire without
creating unrealistic expectations given financial barriers? How do we
involve communities authentically?

**Prototype Scope:** Interactive platform showing healthcare career
pathways with local Arizona role models, salary expectations, and
education requirements---tailored for middle/high school students.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 11: Rural Healthcare Career Pathway Navigator ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Only 29% of rural residents aged 18-24 enroll in
higher education versus 48% urban. Arizona has 29 areas with
population-to-physician ratios exceeding 5,000:1 or no physician at all.
Rural students lack clear pathways to healthcare careers.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Rural Arizona students, rural healthcare
facilities, tribal communities, community colleges serving rural areas

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic career counseling, programs
centered in Phoenix/Tucson inaccessible to rural students, limited
awareness of \"grow your own\" workforce models

**Arizona-Specific Context:** NAU\'s AZ Ahead program serves
rural/tribal communities. YES Program in Yuma shows 95% of participants
likely to earn degrees. ASU Health\'s statewide clinic network creates
potential training sites.

**Global Context:** Norway and Sweden have implemented \"distributed
medical education\" with training in rural communities. Task-shifting
models expand who can provide care.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Do we risk \"brain drain\" by
educating rural students who then leave? How do we create genuine
pathways rather than false promises?

**Prototype Scope:** Decision-support tool mapping rural students\'
local education options to healthcare careers, with virtual mentorship
connections to rural healthcare workers.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 12: Community Health Worker Training Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Community Health Workers (CHWs) are critical for
reaching underserved populations but lack standardized training and
career pathways. Arizona\'s tribal communities have Community Health
Representatives, but training varies widely.

**Affected Stakeholders:** CHWs and CHRs, tribal health departments,
community health centers, underserved community members

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Employer-driven training without
standards, limited certification, high turnover due to lack of career
progression

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona has 100+ Community Health
Representatives serving Navajo Nation alone. CHW programs could address
rural/tribal access gaps highlighted by ASU Health\'s focus on health
equity.

**Global Context:** Brazil and Ethiopia have among world\'s largest CHW
programs with proven impact on vulnerable population health. ROI ranges
from 3:1 to 15:1 when properly implemented.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we professionalize
without pricing out community members? How do we ensure training
respects traditional knowledge?

**Prototype Scope:** Modular training platform for CHWs covering core
competencies with cultural adaptation for Arizona\'s diverse
communities.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 13: Clinical Rotation Housing Finder**

**Problem Statement:** Nursing and medical students traveling to remote
clinical sites face average housing costs of \$3,495 per
student---creating financial barriers that disproportionately affect
lower-income students.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare students, clinical coordinators,
rural rotation sites, students from lower-income backgrounds

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Students find housing independently,
informal networks favor those with social capital, some sites
unavailable due to housing barriers

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s geographic spread means rural
rotations (critical for workforce distribution) often require temporary
relocation. Tribal sites particularly affected by limited nearby
housing.

**Global Context:** Medical schools in Australia and Canada have
implemented distributed housing networks for rural rotations with
success in improving rural workforce recruitment.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does cost burden deter
lower-income students from rural rotations---perpetuating urban
concentration? How do we ensure safety standards in shared housing?

**Prototype Scope:** Housing-sharing platform connecting students with
hosts near clinical sites (similar to Airbnb model), with verification
and reviews.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**1.4 School Health Pipeline**

**Problem 14: School Nurse Workflow Optimizer**

**Problem Statement:** Fewer than 40% of public schools employ a
full-time RN. California\'s ratio is 2,410:1 versus the recommended
1:750. Nurses covering multiple schools can\'t be present for
emergencies, and non-medical staff dispense medications.

**Affected Stakeholders:** School nurses, students with chronic
conditions, school administrators, parents, children relying on school
nurse as only healthcare contact

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Nurses driving between schools,
delegating to unlicensed staff, reactive care when present

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona does not mandate school nurses.
Lower-income districts less likely to have nursing support---affecting
college readiness for students with chronic conditions.

**Global Context:** School nursing ratios vary globally; countries with
national health systems often integrate school health more
systematically.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** When unlicensed staff
dispense medications, who bears liability? How do we advocate for
adequate staffing while supporting current understaffed nurses?

**Prototype Scope:** Workflow management tool helping nurses covering
multiple schools prioritize, track student health plans, and delegate
safely.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 15: Chronic Condition Student Support App**

**Problem Statement:** One in four students has a chronic illness
(asthma, diabetes). Chronic absenteeism due to health issues affects
educational outcomes, yet health management plans are often paper-based
and poorly communicated.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students with chronic conditions, parents,
school nurses, teachers, school administrators

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Paper health plans, poor parent-school
communication, teachers unaware of student needs, medication management
challenges

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s extreme heat exacerbates
respiratory conditions. Students from low-income families less likely to
have care coordinated between school and home.

**Global Context:** Digital health management for chronic conditions
shows improved adherence and outcomes across pediatric populations
globally.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** What health information
should teachers see? How do we empower students without creating stigma?
Privacy considerations for minors?

**Prototype Scope:** Student-friendly app for tracking medications,
symptoms, and triggers with school nurse/parent communication features.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 16: FAFSA Completion Assistant ⭐ High Impact**

**Problem Statement:** Only 45.2% of Arizona 2025 high school graduates
completed FAFSA. FAFSA completion is linked to 127% increase in college
enrollment for low-income students---making this a critical pipeline
issue for both education and healthcare workforce development.

**Affected Stakeholders:** High school seniors, parents (especially
first-generation), school counselors, financial aid offices, future
employers needing educated workforce

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** FAFSA completion nights with limited
attendance, counselor time constraints, complex form intimidating
families

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona has 225 FAFSA Peer Coaches in
Maricopa/Pima counties. College Ready AZ FAFSA Scholarship offers
\$2,000 awards. State ranked 6th in year-over-year improvement but still
has 55% unreached.

**Global Context:** Countries with simplified aid applications (like
UK\'s means-tested grants) show higher completion. Behavioral nudges
proven effective for aid completion.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we reach undocumented
students who fear providing information? How do we support families with
complex financial situations?

**Prototype Scope:** Step-by-step FAFSA guide with document checklist,
deadline reminders, common mistake prevention, and chat support
connection.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**1.5 Advanced Clinical Education Technology**

**Problem 17: Clinical Reasoning Training Simulator with Diagnostic
Uncertainty ⭐ ASU Health Priority + High Difficulty**

**Problem Statement:** Medical diagnostic errors affect 12 million
Americans annually, with 40,000-80,000 deaths attributed to
misdiagnosis. Current clinical training emphasizes pattern recognition
toward \"correct\" diagnoses, but real medicine involves irreducible
uncertainty---multiple conditions present similarly, test results are
probabilistic, and patients don\'t present like textbooks. Students
graduate overconfident in clear-cut diagnoses and underprepared for
ambiguity.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Medical and nursing students, clinical
faculty, simulation center staff, patients who receive misdiagnoses,
malpractice systems, licensing boards assessing competency

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Case-based learning with predetermined
\"right answers,\" simulation mannequins with scripted responses, OSCEs
that reward confident diagnosis over uncertainty acknowledgment, limited
training on communicating diagnostic uncertainty to patients

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU Health\'s John Shufeldt School of
Medicine aims to create a \"new kind of physician\" integrating
engineering thinking. This requires calibrated confidence---knowing what
you don\'t know. Arizona\'s rural areas see delayed diagnosis due to
limited specialist access, making primary care uncertainty management
critical.

**Global Context:** Dual-process theory research shows expert
diagnosticians use both intuitive pattern recognition and analytical
reasoning. Overconfidence bias is well-documented in medical
education---students become more confident but not more accurate as
training progresses. UK and Canadian medical schools are piloting
\"diagnostic uncertainty curricula.\"

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we train appropriate
humility without creating paralysis? When is uncertainty acknowledgment
honest communication versus liability risk? How do we prevent training
that reinforces base-rate neglect for rare conditions in minority
populations? Should diagnostic AI augment or replace uncertainty
training?

**Prototype Scope:** AI-powered clinical case simulator generating
realistic vignettes with built-in ambiguity---cases where multiple
diagnoses are plausible and \"correct\" management involves explicitly
acknowledging uncertainty. System tracks student confidence calibration
(does stated confidence match actual accuracy?), provides feedback on
reasoning chains (not just outcomes), and introduces Bayesian reasoning
for test interpretation. Advanced feature: cases that evolve based on
student decisions, revealing information that should appropriately
update diagnostic confidence.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**PART 2: EDUCATION-ONLY CHALLENGES (16 Problems)**

*Building on the hackathon\'s existing pain points framework while
expanding for Arizona context.*

**2.1 Student Success Challenges**

students who lack family guidance navigating higher education. First-gen
students face higher attrition rates and lower graduation rates than
peers.

**Affected Stakeholders:** First-generation students, families, academic
advisors, retention teams, employers seeking diverse graduates

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic orientation programs,
mentorship matching with limited follow-through, services students
don\'t know exist

**Arizona-Specific Context:** 52% of transfer students at UA are
first-generation. 60% of Hispanic/Latino students in Arizona identify as
first-generation---and Hispanic students are now 50%+ of incoming
classes.

**Global Context:** First-generation challenges are universal but
intensity varies by system. Countries with stronger secondary-tertiary
alignment show better outcomes.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we support without
deficit framing? How do we value family wisdom while providing
institutional navigation?

**Prototype Scope:** Comprehensive resource hub with peer mentoring
matching, family engagement tools (bilingual), and milestone tracking
for first-gen students.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 19: Transfer Student Pathway Navigator**

**Problem Statement:** Transfer students face credit loss, advising
inconsistencies, and \"transfer shock\" affecting persistence. Despite
Arizona\'s AZTransfer system, many students lack awareness of optimal
pathways.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Community college students, transfer
advisors, university admissions, students losing credits/time

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Course-by-course equivalency searches,
inconsistent advising, MyPath2ASU exists but underutilized

**Arizona-Specific Context:** AZTransfer and AGEC provide foundation,
but 10 Maricopa Community College districts mean varied advising
quality. ASU Online receives many transfer students.

**Global Context:** Transfer articulation challenges exist globally.
Best practices include guaranteed admission agreements and centralized
equivalency databases.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we ensure transfer
pathways don\'t become tracking systems that limit options? Are
community college credits valued equitably?

**Prototype Scope:** Visual mapping tool showing credit transfer impact
for different pathways, with optimization suggestions and advisor
matching.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 20: Online Student Engagement Hub**

**Problem Statement:** ASU Online\'s 80,000+ students face unique
isolation challenges. Online students have lower retention rates and
report feeling disconnected from campus community.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Online students, online instructors, student
support services, ASU Online administration

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Discussion boards with low engagement,
generic virtual events, services designed for on-campus students

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU Online grew 9% in fall 2025 with
18,800 new online students. Managing engagement at this scale while
maintaining quality is unprecedented.

**Global Context:** Hybrid models are \"permanent fixtures\" globally.
Research shows blended approaches outperform pure online---suggesting
integration opportunities.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Do online students receive
equitable services for equivalent tuition? How do we build community
authentically rather than performatively?

**Prototype Scope:** Community-building platform with study group
matching, progress tracking, and early intervention triggers for at-risk
online students.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 21: Gateway Course AI Tutor**

**Problem Statement:** High-enrollment gateway courses (math, science,
writing) have high failure rates that predict attrition. Faculty can\'t
provide personalized attention to hundreds of students.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students in gateway courses, faculty,
academic advisors, retention teams

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Large lectures, limited TA
availability, tutoring centers with capacity constraints

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU manages 194,000+ students across
campuses and online. AI-enhanced adaptive learning in gateway courses is
already in development but needs expansion.

**Global Context:** AI tutoring can be as effective as one-on-one human
tutoring (Brookings). Squirrel AI in China showed students scoring 456%
higher in less time with AI-driven personalization.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does AI tutoring advantage
tech-comfortable students? How do we ensure AI doesn\'t perpetuate
biased content? What human oversight is needed?

**Prototype Scope:** AI-powered tutoring assistant for high-enrollment
courses providing personalized explanations, practice problems, and
progress tracking.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 22: Student Financial Wellness App**

**Problem Statement:** Financial stress is a top-five stressor for
college students. Arizona\'s limited state-funded scholarships (Promise
Program cut) and rising tuition create significant burden.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students facing financial stress, financial
aid offices, retention teams, student emergency aid programs

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic financial literacy workshops,
complex scholarship searches, emergency aid with limited awareness

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU added \$350 tuition surcharge for
spring 2025. Arizona ranks 46th for state higher education support.
University of Northern Iowa reduced student debt by \$3,300 per borrower
through financial literacy programming.

**Global Context:** 73% of prospective students globally cite
affordability concerns. Financial barriers affect persistence across all
countries with tuition-based systems.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we address systemic
affordability without victim-blaming individual budgeting? How do we
ensure emergency aid reaches those most in need?

**Prototype Scope:** Budget planning tool with scholarship matching,
emergency aid navigation, and personalized financial milestone tracking.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**2.2 Faculty and Staff Challenges**

**Problem 23: Faculty Workload Equity Dashboard**

**Problem Statement:** Faculty face heavy teaching loads with multiple
courses, large classes, and diverse student needs. Balancing teaching,
research, and service creates burnout, but workload distribution is
often opaque.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Faculty, department chairs, provost offices,
students affected by burned-out instructors

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Self-reported workload tracking,
inequitable distribution, limited visibility into actual demands

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU\'s faculty student ratio is 18:1 with
5,400+ faculty members. Growth pressures increase reliance on adjuncts.
Cost of living in Phoenix affects recruitment/retention.

**Global Context:** Faculty burnout is global phenomenon---majority of
physicians across 10 countries report burnout. Half of older physicians
plan to stop seeing patients within three years.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we measure workload
fairly across different types of work (teaching vs. research vs.
service)? How do we prevent surveillance culture?

**Prototype Scope:** Dashboard visualizing workload across faculty in a
department, identifying inequities and supporting equitable distribution
conversations.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 24: Adjunct Faculty Support Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Universities increasingly rely on
adjunct/part-time faculty who often teach at multiple institutions, lack
benefits, and have limited access to support resources.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Adjunct faculty, full-time faculty taking on
advising load, students taught by under-supported instructors

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Per-course contracts with limited
integration, separate onboarding at each institution, minimal
professional development

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU\'s growth has increased adjunct
reliance. Community colleges heavily use adjuncts. Competition from gig
economy and industry.

**Global Context:** Adjunctification is a global trend in higher
education, raising quality and equity concerns across systems.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Are we exploiting adjunct
labor? How do we provide support without creating two-tiered systems
that maintain inequality?

**Prototype Scope:** Resource hub for adjunct faculty across Arizona
institutions with teaching resources, community connection, and
professional development opportunities.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 25: Research Grant Matching Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Faculty spend significant time searching for
funding opportunities. Competition for grants is fierce, and application
processes are complex. Matching researchers to appropriate opportunities
is inefficient.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Research faculty, sponsored programs offices,
graduate students dependent on research funding

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic funding databases, manual
searches, missed deadlines, duplicated effort across institutions

**Arizona-Specific Context:** State funding cuts mean universities
increasingly depend on external research funding. ASU Health\'s Mayo
Clinic partnership includes seed grant programs.

**Global Context:** Research funding competition is intense globally.
AI-powered grant matching is emerging but not yet widespread.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does better grant-finding
advantage already-privileged researchers? How do we support emerging
scholars?

**Prototype Scope:** AI-powered matching platform connecting faculty
research interests with appropriate funding opportunities, with deadline
tracking and proposal guidance.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**2.3 Staff Operations Challenges**

**Problem 26: Student Support Request Triage**

**Problem Statement:** Staff are overwhelmed by student requests, many
of which could be addressed through self-service or AI. High volumes
prevent staff from helping students with complex needs.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Student services staff, students with urgent
needs, supervisors managing capacity

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Email queues with long response times,
phone holds, students giving up before getting help

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU\'s scale means support staff serve
massive student populations. 42,900 new students enrolled fall 2025
alone.

**Global Context:** AI chatbots for student services are expanding
globally. Best implementations triage to humans for complex issues.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** When does automation
depersonalize essential support? How do we ensure AI doesn\'t
disadvantage students who need human interaction?

**Prototype Scope:** AI triage system routing student inquiries to
self-service, AI chat, or human staff based on complexity and urgency.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 27: Cross-Department Coordination Tool**

**Problem Statement:** Staff members juggle multiple roles and
coordinate across departments with different systems. Students
experience fragmented services as a result.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Staff across departments, students navigating
multiple offices, administrators seeking efficiency

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Siloed systems, manual handoffs,
students repeating information to multiple offices

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU\'s complexity (four campuses plus
online) means students may interact with many departments. Integration
challenges amplified by scale.

**Global Context:** Student success management platforms are growing
globally, but integration with existing systems remains challenging.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we share student
information appropriately across departments? What consent is needed?

**Prototype Scope:** Shared dashboard allowing staff to see student
interactions across departments, reducing repetition and improving
coordination.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**2.4 Institutional Effectiveness**

**Problem 28: K-12 Partnership Coordination Dashboard**

**Problem Statement:** Universities partner with K-12 districts but
coordination is fragmented. Programs duplicate effort while leaving
gaps. Only 22 of 100 Arizona K-12 students go to college; only 6 obtain
bachelor\'s degrees.

**Affected Stakeholders:** K-12 students, school counselors, university
outreach staff, communities with low college-going rates

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Scattered programs, inconsistent
contact across districts, limited data on what works

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona ranks 45th nationally in Pre-K-12
education. Wide variation in outcomes---students at top 10% of schools
have \~50% college completion vs. \<10% at bottom 60%.

**Global Context:** Countries with strong secondary-tertiary alignment
(like Finland) show better transition outcomes. Data-sharing between
sectors improves targeting.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Are partnerships genuinely
serving students or primarily recruiting? How do we reach
under-resourced schools?

**Prototype Scope:** Coordination platform tracking K-12 partnership
activities across university units, identifying gaps and measuring
outcomes by community.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 29: Employer Skills Alignment Tool**

**Problem Statement:** 85% of employers claim skills-based hiring, but
only 0.14% of actual hires were affected by degree requirement removals.
Skills-based language isn\'t translating to hiring outcomes.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Graduates seeking employment, career
services, employers, curriculum developers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic career services, job boards
focused on degree requirements, limited employer-education dialogue
about actual skills

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s semiconductor boom (TSMC\'s
\$65+ billion investment) creates acute skills needs. 140,000+
semiconductor-relevant jobs in Phoenix metro need trained workers.

**Global Context:** Companies succeeding at skills-based hiring (Apple,
Cigna, GM) hired 18% more non-degreed workers with 10% higher retention.
Technical roles filled 40% faster using skills-first approaches.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Do skills assessments
inadvertently discriminate? How do we value credentials while opening
pathways for skills-based hiring?

**Prototype Scope:** Skills mapping tool connecting program learning
outcomes to employer skill requirements, with portfolio generation for
students.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 30: Microcredential Stackable Pathway Designer**

**Problem Statement:** Students want flexible pathways that provide
value along the way. 36.8 million Americans have \"some college, no
credential.\" Microcredentials could provide value but pathways are
unclear.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Adult learners, students needing flexibility,
employers seeking specific skills, credential evaluators

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Standalone certificates without clear
stacking, employer unfamiliarity with microcredentials, transcript
limitations

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona community colleges now offer
bachelor\'s degrees. Maricopa Accelerated Semiconductor Training (MAST)
shows industry-aligned credential demand.

**Global Context:** 76% of trade school graduates believe skills-based
education worth the cost. Stackable credentials growing globally as
alternative pathways.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Do microcredentials create
second-tier education? How do we ensure quality and prevent predatory
providers?

**Prototype Scope:** Visual pathway designer showing how
microcredentials stack toward degrees, with employer recognition data
and enrollment guidance.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 31: Sustainability and Climate Impact Tracker**

**Problem Statement:** Universities face pressure to reduce
environmental impact and prepare students for climate challenges.
Arizona faces extreme heat, drought, and wildfire risks affecting campus
operations.

**Affected Stakeholders:** University operations, students concerned
about climate, surrounding communities, future generations

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Scattered sustainability initiatives,
limited visibility into progress, climate adaptation planning reactive

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU ranks top 10 globally for UN
Sustainable Development Goals. Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures
Laboratory addresses water sustainability. Extreme heat affects outdoor
activities and building energy use.

**Global Context:** Health sector responsible for \~5% of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Universities globally moving toward carbon
neutrality commitments.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we balance
institutional sustainability with student affordability? Who bears costs
of climate adaptation?

**Prototype Scope:** Dashboard tracking sustainability metrics with
student engagement features and heat-responsive campus activity
recommendations.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 32: Rural Student Virtual Campus Experience**

**Problem Statement:** 13+ million Americans live in \"education
deserts.\" Rural Arizona students lack exposure to campus life that
influences enrollment and persistence decisions.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Rural prospective students, admissions
offices, rural high school counselors, families

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Physical campus visits require travel,
virtual tours are passive, limited personalization

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s vast rural areas exceed most
comparisons. Limited broadband affects video quality. 29% of rural
residents aged 18-24 enrolled in higher education versus 48% urban.

**Global Context:** VR campus tours are expanding globally. Best
practices combine technology with human connection (virtual student
ambassadors).

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does virtual access
substitute for or complement physical access? How do we represent campus
authentically?

**Prototype Scope:** Interactive virtual campus experience with peer
connections, major exploration, and career outcome data tailored for
rural students.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**2.5 Educational Data and Equity**

**Problem 33: Equity Gap Identifier and Intervention Router ⭐ ASU
Health Priority + High Difficulty**

**Problem Statement:** Educational institutions collect vast data on
student outcomes but struggle to translate disparities into actionable
interventions. Achievement gaps persist across race, income,
first-generation status, and geography---but knowing a gap exists
differs from knowing why it exists or what to do about it. Current
dashboards show disparities without diagnosing root causes or routing to
evidence-based interventions.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Underperforming student populations,
institutional research offices, academic advisors, diversity/equity
offices, accreditors requiring equity metrics, faculty teaching gateway
courses, community partners

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Static equity dashboards showing gaps
without causation, annual reports that don\'t drive action, generic
\"support services\" not tailored to specific gap drivers, interventions
applied uniformly rather than targeted to identified causes

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s demographic shifts mean
Hispanic students are now 50%+ of incoming classes---making equity gaps
increasingly consequential for overall institutional outcomes. ASU\'s
charter commitment to \"those to whom it may not have been historically
available\" demands moving beyond identifying gaps to closing them. The
22-of-100 K-12-to-degree completion rate masks vast variation by
community.

**Global Context:** Evidence-based education interventions exist but
adoption is slow. Randomized controlled trials in education remain rare.
UK\'s What Works Clearinghouse and similar repositories catalog
interventions but don\'t match to local contexts. Precision education
(targeting interventions based on individual characteristics) is
emerging but not at scale.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does disaggregating data by
race/income create risk of stereotyping or punitive targeting? Who
decides which gaps matter most? How do we avoid \"deficit framing\" that
locates problems in students rather than systems? When is an
intervention evidence-based enough to deploy at scale? How do we handle
the tension between urgency (students failing now) and rigor (wanting
certainty about interventions)?

**Prototype Scope:** Multi-layer diagnostic system that: (1) identifies
statistically significant outcome gaps across student populations, (2)
applies causal inference techniques to distinguish correlation from
likely causation (e.g., is the gap driven by academic preparation,
financial stress, belonging concerns, or course scheduling patterns?),
(3) matches diagnosed root causes to evidence-based interventions from a
curated repository, and (4) routes specific students to specific
interventions with tracking. Advanced feature: simulation mode showing
projected impact of intervention portfolios before deployment, with
confidence intervals reflecting evidence strength.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**PART 3: HEALTH-ONLY CHALLENGES (17 Problems)**

*Prioritizing challenges aligned with ASU Health\'s strategic
priorities: workforce, AI/technology, health equity, and data-driven
decision-making.*

**3.1 Healthcare Workforce Solutions**

**Problem 34: Healthcare Worker Burnout Detection ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** 3 in 10 healthcare workers considered leaving the
profession; 6 in 10 said the pandemic harmed their mental health. Half
of physicians 55+ plan to stop seeing patients within three years.
Burnout detection happens too late.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare workers, patients receiving care
from burned-out providers, healthcare administrators, families of
workers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Annual surveys missing real-time
issues, reactive wellness programs, stigma around seeking help

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s severe workforce shortage means
burned-out workers can\'t be easily replaced. Rural and tribal
facilities especially vulnerable to departures.

**Global Context:** Commonwealth Fund finds majority of primary care
doctors across 10 countries report burnout. Younger physicians more
affected---threatening future workforce.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does monitoring create
surveillance concerns? How do we prevent data misuse for termination
decisions? What\'s employers\' responsibility?

**Prototype Scope:** Voluntary wellness check-in tool for healthcare
workers with personalized resource recommendations and anonymous
aggregate reporting to administrators.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 35: Smart Scheduling for Healthcare Shifts**

**Problem Statement:** Healthcare scheduling often creates inequitable
workloads, last-minute changes, and burnout. Staff feel they have no
control over their lives outside work.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nurses, physicians, scheduling coordinators,
patients affected by short-staffing

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Manual scheduling, seniority-based
systems that burden newer workers, limited consideration of worker
preferences

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s staffing shortages mean
remaining workers absorb extra shifts. Travel nurse reliance creates
scheduling complexity.

**Global Context:** AI-powered scheduling optimization shows promise in
reducing burnout while maintaining coverage. Shared Medical Appointments
model extends provider capacity.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we balance operational
needs with worker wellbeing? Do algorithms inadvertently discriminate?

**Prototype Scope:** AI-assisted scheduling tool optimizing for
coverage, equity, and worker preferences with shift-swap facilitation.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 36: Preceptor Recognition and Support Platform ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Clinical preceptors who train students do so on
top of patient care duties with limited recognition or compensation.
This limits willingness to precept, creating placement shortages.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Clinical preceptors, healthcare students,
nursing/medical schools, healthcare facilities

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Occasional appreciation events, some
CME credit, limited financial incentive

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s \$25 million preceptor training
investment aims to add 1,145 new preceptors. Creating sustainable
recognition systems extends this investment\'s impact.

**Global Context:** Countries with formal preceptor recognition systems
show higher willingness to train students. Micro-credentials for
preceptors emerging.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Should precepting be
compensated, or does that create wrong incentives? How do we value
teaching in clinical settings?

**Prototype Scope:** Platform recognizing preceptor contributions,
tracking hours, providing development resources, and facilitating peer
community.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 37: Healthcare Workforce Retention Forecaster ⭐ ASU Health
Priority + High Difficulty**

**Problem Statement:** Healthcare facilities operate reactively to
turnover---scrambling to fill positions after resignations rather than
intervening before departure. Arizona loses an estimated
\$50,000-\$100,000 per nurse turnover in recruitment and training costs,
yet predictable warning signs (schedule changes, reduced engagement,
peer departures) go unmonitored. The healthcare workforce crisis isn\'t
just about recruitment; it\'s about retention of existing workers who
leave preventable departures.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare workers considering departure, HR
departments, nurse managers, hospital CFOs, patients affected by
staffing instability, remaining staff absorbing workload from vacancies,
healthcare workforce researchers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Exit interviews (too late), annual
engagement surveys (too infrequent and aggregated), turnover dashboards
showing historical rates without prediction, reactive retention bonuses
offered after notice given, generic wellness programs not targeted to
at-risk individuals

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s 28,100 projected nursing
shortage by 2025 (worst in nation) means every preventable departure
compounds the crisis. Rural and tribal facilities face 2-3x higher
turnover than urban hospitals. The \$25 million preceptor investment is
wasted if trained preceptors leave. ASU Health\'s new workforce entering
practice needs retention systems from day one.

**Global Context:** Turnover prediction models from other industries
(tech, retail) show 70-80% accuracy 90 days before departure.
Healthcare-specific models are emerging but not deployed at scale. NHS
in UK experimented with \"flight risk\" dashboards; ethical concerns
about individual targeting limited adoption. Scandinavian countries show
lower healthcare turnover through system-level interventions (workload
caps, schedule predictability).

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does predicting individual
departure risk create surveillance that accelerates turnover? How do we
prevent retention interventions from becoming coercive? Who sees
individual-level predictions vs. aggregate trends? Should workers know
their \"risk score\"? How do we distinguish healthy turnover (career
advancement) from problematic turnover (burnout departure)? If we
predict someone will leave, is offering them resources manipulation or
support?

**Prototype Scope:** Predictive analytics platform that: (1) ingests
workforce signals (schedule patterns, PTO usage, tenure cohort, peer
network departures, workload metrics, training completion) without
requiring invasive new data collection, (2) generates unit-level and
role-level retention risk forecasts (not individual targeting in initial
version), (3) models counterfactual interventions (\"if we offered
schedule flexibility, predicted retention would increase X%\"), (4)
recommends evidence-based retention interventions matched to diagnosed
risk factors, and (5) tracks intervention effectiveness over time.
Advanced feature: simulation mode allowing administrators to test policy
changes (staffing ratios, compensation adjustments) against predicted
retention impact before implementation.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**3.2 Patient Care Innovation**

**Problem 38: Heat Vulnerability Early Warning System ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Arizona\'s heat-related deaths increased 1,000%
since 2010s. Maricopa County recorded 645 deaths in 2023. Current
interventions are reactive rather than predictive.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Vulnerable individuals (homeless, elderly,
outdoor workers), public health departments, emergency services,
families of victims

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Cooling centers often closed when
still dangerous (nights/weekends), welfare checks are
resource-intensive, high-risk individuals unknown until crisis

**Arizona-Specific Context:** 49% of heat deaths involved homeless
individuals. 57% involved substance use. Health Observatory launched
Arizona Social Vulnerability Index in October 2024 for better targeting.

**Global Context:** Heat vulnerability indices exist globally but
predictive models combining weather, individual risk, and intervention
capacity are emerging. WHO projects 250,000 additional climate-related
deaths annually by 2030.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we identify vulnerable
individuals without surveillance overreach? What resources must
accompany alerts to make them actionable?

**Prototype Scope:** Predictive system combining weather data, social
vulnerability indices, and historical patterns to trigger proactive
outreach to high-risk individuals.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 39: Senior Fall Prevention and Detection**

**Problem Statement:** Falls are a leading cause of injury and death
among older adults. 1.5 million Arizonans are over 60, and many live
alone. Falls often go undetected until serious.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Seniors aging in place, family caregivers,
home health workers, emergency services

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Medical alert buttons require user
activation, wearables with limited adoption, family checking in
reactively

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s large retiree population faces
heat-related fall risk (dehydration affects balance). Many live in
sprawling communities far from family.

**Global Context:** AI-powered fall detection is advancing rapidly.
Japan and Nordic countries lead in senior living technology due to aging
demographics.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we monitor seniors
without infantilizing them? What\'s the balance between safety and
autonomy?

**Prototype Scope:** AI-based fall detection using smartphone sensors
with automatic alert escalation and caregiver notification.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 40: Medication Adherence for Chronic Conditions**

**Problem Statement:** Only about 50% of patients take medications as
prescribed. Non-adherence causes 125,000+ deaths and costs \$100-300
billion annually in the US.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Patients with chronic conditions, family
caregivers, pharmacists, healthcare providers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Pill organizers, pharmacy reminders
ignored, complex regimens for multiple conditions

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s aging population faces
polypharmacy challenges. One in three Navajo are diabetic or
pre-diabetic, requiring consistent medication management.

**Global Context:** Digital adherence tools show promise but face
adoption barriers. Simplest interventions (text reminders) often most
effective.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does monitoring adherence
create coercion? How do we address cost-related non-adherence versus
forgetting?

**Prototype Scope:** Personalized medication reminder app with refill
tracking, drug interaction alerts, and caregiver communication features.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 41: Rural Telehealth Optimization ⭐ ASU Health Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Telehealth could solve rural access, but 33% of
tribal reservation residents only have smartphone internet. Low
bandwidth makes video visits unreliable.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Rural patients, providers offering
telehealth, tribal communities, elderly with limited tech skills

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Video visits require high bandwidth,
asynchronous options limited, technical support unavailable

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s rural and tribal communities
face severe provider shortages. ASU Health\'s statewide clinic network
could anchor telehealth expansion.

**Global Context:** Sweden\'s \"virtual community rooms\" provide 24/7
self-monitoring access. Norway achieves 100% regional telehealth
adoption with appropriate technology matching.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Does telehealth create
two-tiered care (in-person for some, virtual for others)? How do we
maintain care quality remotely?

**Prototype Scope:** Low-bandwidth telehealth interface with
audio-focused consultations, store-and-forward image capture, and
offline symptom logging.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**3.3 Public Health and Health Equity**

**Problem 42: Opioid Overdose Prediction Dashboard ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Arizona drug overdose death rate is 36 per
100,000---14% above national average. Fentanyl accounts for 60% of drug
deaths with a 4,900% increase since 2015. More than 5 people die daily.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Individuals with substance use disorders,
families, first responders, public health departments, naloxone
distribution programs

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Reactive overdose response, naloxone
distribution without targeting, limited real-time surveillance

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Health Observatory launched machine
learning model to predict overdose death risk in January
2025---hackathon teams could extend or apply this work.

**Global Context:** Harm reduction approaches show success in Portugal
and other countries. AI prediction models emerging for overdose risk
stratification.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we use prediction
without stigmatizing or criminalizing? Does data collection deter
treatment-seeking?

**Prototype Scope:** Community-level risk visualization showing overdose
hotspots, naloxone distribution gaps, and intervention opportunities.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 43: Bilingual Health Navigation for Border Communities**

**Problem Statement:** 187.8 million northbound border crossings occur
at Arizona-Mexico border annually. Border communities face elevated
infectious disease rates, farmworker health needs, and binational care
coordination challenges.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Border community residents, migrant
populations, farmworkers, binational families, community health centers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Language barriers in healthcare,
fragmented binational coordination, insurance complications for
cross-border care

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Yuma and Santa Cruz counties have 100% of
populations in HPSAs. Agricultural workers face pesticide exposure and
heat illness requiring culturally-competent care.

**Global Context:** Border health programs exist worldwide. EU has
frameworks for cross-border care coordination that could inform
US-Mexico approaches.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we provide care
regardless of documentation status? How do we respect community while
improving health outcomes?

**Prototype Scope:** Bilingual health navigation app connecting border
community members to appropriate services, with translation support and
cross-border resource information.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 44: Tribal Health Cultural Adaptation Platform ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Native Americans experience 2.5x higher
psychological distress than general population. Traditional healing
practices aren\'t reimbursable by Medicaid. Health interventions often
fail due to cultural mismatch.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Tribal community members, traditional
healers, Community Health Representatives, IHS facilities

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Western health apps without cultural
adaptation, generic interventions ignoring traditional knowledge, Navajo
language support lacking

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona is home to 22 federally recognized
tribes. Navajo Nation spans 27,000 square miles with 350,000+ enrolled
members. One in three Navajo families live without piped water or
electricity.

**Global Context:** WHO emphasizes culturally-appropriate care.
Indigenous health programs in Australia and Canada show better outcomes
when community-designed.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Who owns traditional
knowledge incorporated into health tools? How do we avoid extractive
technology development?

**Prototype Scope:** Health app co-designed with tribal communities,
incorporating language support, traditional practices alongside Western
medicine, and CHR coordination.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 45: Valley Fever Early Detection ⭐ ASU Health Priority**

**Problem Statement:** Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis) is endemic to
Arizona, caused by inhaling fungal spores from desert soil. Climate
change and construction are increasing exposure.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Arizona residents, outdoor workers,
construction workers, healthcare providers often unfamiliar with
diagnosis

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Frequently misdiagnosed as pneumonia,
limited public awareness, surveillance gaps

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Health Observatory is researching Valley
Fever by integrating weather, land cover, and environmental data with
air filter data---hackathon teams could build on this.

**Global Context:** Climate change is expanding range of soil-dwelling
pathogens globally. Early warning systems emerging for environmental
health threats.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we balance economic
development (construction) with exposure risk communication? Who bears
responsibility for worker protection?

**Prototype Scope:** Symptom checker and risk assessment tool for Valley
Fever, with provider education resources and surveillance data
contribution.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**3.4 Healthcare Administration and Data**

**Problem 46: Hospital Capacity Real-Time Dashboard ⭐ ASU Health
Priority**

**Problem Statement:** During COVID-19, Arizona created the Surge Line
to transfer 5,500+ patients from overwhelmed facilities. No centralized
capacity visibility existed before the pandemic.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Hospital administrators, emergency services,
patients needing transfer, public health departments

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Phone calls between facilities, manual
reporting, delayed visibility into system status

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona Surge Line transferred patients
during COVID, with 90% from rural facilities. AI/AN populations
disproportionately transferred. Infrastructure should be maintained for
future surges.

**Global Context:** Hungary\'s mobile healthcare units coordinate
through real-time dashboards. Centralized bed management shows improved
patient flow in European systems.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** How do we share competitive
information between healthcare systems? Who controls and accesses
capacity data?

**Prototype Scope:** Real-time dashboard showing hospital capacity
across Arizona regions, with transfer coordination features and surge
early warning.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 47: Health Data Interoperability Connector**

**Problem Statement:** Patient data is fragmented across providers.
Patients repeat their history at every visit. Care coordination suffers
when providers lack complete information.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Patients, primary care providers,
specialists, emergency departments, care coordinators

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Patient portals at each provider,
fax-based records transfer, manual data entry

**Arizona-Specific Context:** ASU Health\'s \"learning health
ecosystem\" requires data flow across partners. Health Observatory needs
integrated data for analytics.

**Global Context:** Nordic countries have national health information
exchanges. US lags in interoperability despite decades of effort.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Who owns patient data? How do
we balance data sharing for care with privacy protection? What consent
is needed?

**Prototype Scope:** Patient-controlled health record aggregator
allowing individuals to compile and share their information across
providers.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 48: AI-Assisted Clinical Documentation**

**Problem Statement:** Clinicians spend up to 50% of their time on
documentation. Documentation burden contributes to burnout and takes
time from patient care.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Physicians, nurses, medical scribes, patients
receiving shorter visits

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Manual documentation, templates with
limited personalization, scribes expensive and not scalable

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s workforce shortage means
documentation burden falls on fewer workers. Reducing administrative
burden is a top opportunity identified by ASU Health.

**Global Context:** Microsoft Dragon Copilot, Google\'s healthcare AI
suite, and similar tools are transforming clinical documentation
globally. FDA has approved 1,300+ AI-enabled medical devices.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Who reviews AI-generated
documentation for accuracy? How do we prevent automation bias? Patient
consent for AI involvement?

**Prototype Scope:** Voice-to-note tool capturing patient encounters and
generating structured documentation for clinician review.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 49: Patient Transportation Coordination**

**Problem Statement:** 14.1% of Arizona adults report medical costs as
barrier to care. Transportation is often the actual barrier---patients
can\'t get to appointments, especially in rural areas.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Patients without transportation, elderly
patients, rural residents, healthcare facilities experiencing no-shows

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Medicaid transportation programs with
complex requirements, volunteer driver programs with limited capacity,
missed appointments costly for patients and providers

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s vast geography means some rural
residents travel 100+ miles for specialty care. Heat makes waiting for
rides dangerous.

**Global Context:** UK NHS has non-emergency patient transport.
Ride-share medical transportation partnerships growing but not
universal.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Is transportation a
healthcare responsibility? How do we ensure safety standards for medical
transport?

**Prototype Scope:** Ride coordination platform connecting patients with
transportation resources (Medicaid, volunteer drivers, ride-share) based
on appointment needs.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Problem 50: Caregiver Support and Respite Finder**

**Problem Statement:** 870,000 family caregivers in Arizona provide
unpaid care. Caregiver burnout affects both caregiver health and care
quality. Respite options are limited and hard to find.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Family caregivers, care recipients, Area
Agencies on Aging, respite care providers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Scattered respite programs, long
waitlists, caregivers unaware of available support

**Arizona-Specific Context:** Arizona\'s aging population creates
growing caregiver needs. Limited adult day services and respite options,
especially outside Phoenix/Tucson metros.

**Global Context:** Countries with formal caregiver support systems
(Germany, Netherlands) show better caregiver health outcomes. Digital
platforms connecting caregivers to respite emerging.

**Ethical Considerations (PI Framework):** Do we undervalue unpaid care
work? How do we support caregivers without assuming care should remain
in families?

**Prototype Scope:** Respite care finder connecting caregivers with
available services, support group matching, and self-care resource
recommendations.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**PROBLEM SELECTION CRITERIA**

For problem bank curation, prioritize problems that:

1\. Are solvable at prototype level in 2.5 days - All 50 problems
include scoped prototypes achievable by student teams

2\. Demonstrate Principled Innovation application - Each includes
ethical considerations for framework application

3\. Have clear stakeholders and measurable impact - Affected
stakeholders identified for each problem

4\. Allow for AI/technology solutions without requiring production-grade
systems - Focus on demonstrating concept and value proposition

5\. Align with ASU Health priorities - 18+ problems directly support ASU
Health\'s strategic goals

6\. Address Arizona-specific challenges with global relevance - All
problems include both Arizona context and global perspective

*This problem bank provides the foundation for meaningful hackathon
projects that can advance both educational innovation and Arizona\'s
health outcomes.*

**HIGH-DIFFICULTY DIFFERENTIATION PROBLEMS**

Three problems are specifically designed as high-difficulty challenges
to differentiate top-performing teams:

**Problem 17: Clinical Reasoning Training Simulator with Diagnostic
Uncertainty**

*Requires modeling epistemic uncertainty, calibrated confidence
tracking, and multi-state case evolution*

**Problem 33: Equity Gap Identifier and Intervention Router**

*Requires causal inference techniques, intervention matching algorithms,
and simulation modeling*

**Problem 37: Healthcare Workforce Retention Forecaster**

*Requires predictive modeling with sparse data, counterfactual
simulation, and careful ethical navigation*

These problems reward teams that conduct thorough domain research,
architect sophisticated systems, and navigate complex ethical
tradeoffs---distinguishing teams that build thoughtfully from those that
build quickly.
