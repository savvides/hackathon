Principled Innovation (PI)

PI is at the heart of this hackathon. You\'ll attend a 2-hour workshop
on Day 1 that grounds everything you build. The core idea: design
solutions that work *for* people, not just *at* problems. Judges will
look for evidence of ethical reasoning throughout your project.

The 7 Guiding Principles

1.  **Understanding Context** --- Who\'s affected? What\'s their history
    and experience?

2.  **Reflecting Throughout** --- Pause. Check assumptions. Revisit
    decisions.

3.  **Connecting to Stakeholders** --- Build relationships. Find common
    goals.

4.  **Inquiring Deeply** --- Research root causes. Seek diverse
    perspectives.

5.  **Imagining Possibilities** --- Generate creative solutions.
    Consider consequences.

6.  **Iterating by Action** --- Test ideas. Gather feedback. Refine.

7.  **Communicating Throughout** --- Share learnings, progress, and
    outcomes.

What Judges Look For

Strong projects will:

-   Name at least 3 PI principles you applied

-   Identify specific ethical considerations for your problem/solution

-   Consider multiple stakeholder perspectives

-   Show a design decision influenced by ethical reasoning

-   Discuss potential unintended consequences and mitigations

**APPENDIX**

Problem Bank

*50 Challenges in Education and Healthcare*

Your team will select one problem from this bank. For each problem, you
will:

8.  Identify ethical considerations using the PI framework

9.  Design and build a prototype solution

10. Present your work to judges and peers

**Intersection of Education & Health**

**Problem 1: Clinical Placement Matching Crisis**

**Problem Statement:** Nursing and medical schools turned away 91,938
qualified applicants in 2021-2022 due to insufficient clinical placement
sites. Arizona faces the nation\'s worst projected nursing
shortage---28,100 nurses short by 2025---yet hospitals are too
understaffed to train students.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nursing/medical/PA students, clinical
coordinators, hospital preceptors, patients awaiting care, healthcare
systems experiencing shortages

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Students travel farther for rotations
(averaging \$3,495 in remote housing costs), simulation replaces
hands-on time, schools pay hospitals for placements---all increasing
costs without addressing root capacity issues

**Arizona Context:** State allocated \$25 million annually for preceptor
training (HB 2691), projecting 1,145 new preceptors and 460 new nursing
students. ASU Health\'s HonorHealth partnership aims to expand clinical
training capacity for the new medical school starting 2026.

**Global Context:** One in four nursing students in England leave or
suspend studies. The challenge is universal---clinical placements
comprise one-third of healthcare students\' university time across OECD
nations.

**Problem 2: Healthcare Student Competency Tracking**

**Problem Statement:** Medical education is transitioning from
time-based to competency-based models, but 80% of clinical education
occurs in inpatient settings while 80-90% of medicine is practiced
outpatient. No unified system tracks student mastery across multiple
rotation sites.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare students, clinical faculty,
licensing boards, future patients

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Paper-based evaluations, inconsistent
assessment standards across sites, competencies verified by time spent
rather than demonstrated skill

**Arizona Context:** ASU Health\'s John Shufeldt School of Medicine will
require dual MD/MS degrees with engineering competencies---demanding
novel assessment approaches. Only \~58% of medical schools nationally
incorporate telehealth curriculum despite its importance in rural
Arizona.

**Global Context:** WHO endorses competency-based education globally.
Countries like Scotland have implemented e-portfolios for continuous
competency tracking across rotations.

**Problem 3: Interprofessional Education Simulation**

**Problem Statement:** Healthcare professionals train in silos but
practice requires team-based collaboration. Physicians, nurses, and
pharmacists rarely learn together despite treating the same patients.

**Affected Stakeholders:** All healthcare students, clinical educators,
patients experiencing care coordination failures

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Occasional interdisciplinary events,
siloed curricula, communication skills deferred until practice when
errors affect real patients

**Arizona Context:** ASU Health\'s curriculum explicitly integrates
\"interprofessional collaboration\" as a core theme. The ecosystem
includes nursing (Edson College), medicine (Shufeldt School), public
health technology, and health solutions---natural partners for IPE.

**Global Context:** Simulation-based IPE shows improved teamwork and
reduced medical errors in Canadian and UK studies. WHO identifies IPE as
essential for meeting health workforce challenges.

**Problem 4: Nursing Faculty Recruitment Platform**

**Problem Statement:** 2,166 full-time nursing faculty vacancies exist
across 909 nursing schools, with 84% requiring doctoral degrees. The
\$30,000+ salary gap between teaching and clinical practice drives
nurses away from academia, creating a bottleneck that prevents training
more nurses.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nursing schools, clinical nurses interested
in teaching, nursing students, healthcare systems needing nurses

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Schools rely heavily on
part-time/adjunct faculty, one-third of nursing faculty over age 60
approaching retirement

**Arizona Context:** 94 vacant full-time faculty positions across 38
Arizona nursing colleges. Arizona\'s \$25 million preceptor training
investment could be leveraged for faculty pathways.

**Global Context:** Faculty shortages affect nursing education globally.
Philippines\' Nurse Education Loan Program combines loans with
coaching---a model for faculty development.

**Problem 5: Campus Mental Health Navigation**

**Problem Statement:** 46% of college students have a diagnosed mental
health condition, but counseling centers can\'t meet demand---counselor
utilization grew 5x faster than enrollment. Students face 6+ week
waitlists; those waitlisted show 14% higher attrition rates.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students with mental health needs, counseling
center staff, academic advisors, families, universities experiencing
retention challenges

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Limited counseling center hours, long
waitlists, students unaware of services or deterred by stigma,
crisis-focused rather than preventive

**Arizona Context:** ASU was recognized in 2018 as one of seven best
U.S. colleges for wellness programming. Large commuter and online
populations (80,000+ ASU Online students) face unique isolation
challenges.

**Global Context:** The crisis is global---Dartmouth/UN research links
declining youth mental health to smartphone adoption worldwide.
Successful interventions include peer support models and
curriculum-embedded wellness.

**Problem 6: Peer Mental Health Support Matching**

**Problem Statement:** 63% of struggling students don\'t seek
professional support, but peer support is students\' #1 preferred method
for emotional support. Formal peer support programs exist but lack
effective matching systems.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students seeking support, peer counselors,
counseling centers, student affairs staff

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic peer support training, random
matching, limited follow-up, unclear escalation pathways

**Arizona Context:** ASU\'s scale (194,000+ students) makes peer support
essential for extending mental health reach. First-generation students
(33% of ASU undergraduates) particularly benefit from peer connections.

**Global Context:** Peer support models show success globally in
reducing stigma and extending capacity. UK universities report improved
help-seeking when peer programs are visible.

**Problem 7: Student Burnout Early Detection**

**Problem Statement:** 70% of students report struggling with mental
health since starting college, and 51% have skipped class due to mental
health. Early intervention prevents attrition, but warning signs go
undetected until crisis.

**Affected Stakeholders:** At-risk students, academic advisors, faculty,
families, retention teams

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Reactive crisis response, self-report
surveys with low response rates, faculty informally observing but
lacking systems to report concerns

**Arizona Context:** ASU\'s 86.6% retention rate is 1.2 percentage
points below enterprise goals. Gateway course performance often signals
burnout before students seek help.

**Global Context:** Wearable AI detecting stress among students is
advancing globally. AI analysis of emotional diaries identifies
depression with \~90% accuracy in research settings.

**Problem 8: Health Professions Student Resilience Support**

**Problem Statement:** Nursing students experience 19-46% burnout
prevalence, with 41% experiencing high emotional exhaustion. Burnout
increases through academic progression and worsens during clinical
rotations with patient contact, contributing to high attrition.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nursing/medical/health professions students,
clinical faculty, program administrators, healthcare systems losing
future workers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Wellness workshops disconnected from
curriculum, limited processing support for difficult clinical
experiences, stigma around seeking help in \"tough\" healthcare culture

**Arizona Context:** Given Arizona\'s nursing shortage, every student
who leaves due to burnout worsens the crisis. ASU Health\'s focus on
\"humanism and patient-centric care\" requires addressing student
wellbeing.

**Global Context:** Meta-analysis found nurse burnout associated with
lower patient safety, more medication errors. Some universities reduced
depression, anxiety, and stress through curricular changes.

**Problem 9: Health Information Credibility Checker**

**Problem Statement:** Only 23.2% of college students demonstrate
excellent health literacy. 7.3% are inadequate, and 29.8%
problematic/limited. Students struggle to evaluate online health
information quality amid \"information pollution.\"

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students making health decisions, campus
health services, public health educators, patients (long-term)

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** No systematic health literacy
curriculum in general education, reliance on students\' own evaluation
skills

**Arizona Context:** ASU Health explicitly includes \"Health Literacy\"
as an ecosystem component---expanding health literacy so people make
informed decisions is a core strategic priority.

**Global Context:** Research links limited health literacy to higher
stress, depression, and lower quality of life. Digital health literacy
skills increasingly critical as telehealth expands.

**Problem 10: K-12 Healthcare Career Exposure Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Racial and ethnic minorities are severely
underrepresented in healthcare. Black representation ranges from 3.3%
(physical therapists) to 11.4% (respiratory therapists) versus 12.1% of
workforce. The number of Black men in medical school hasn\'t increased
since 1978.

**Affected Stakeholders:** K-12 students from underrepresented
backgrounds, school counselors, healthcare diversity officers,
underserved communities lacking diverse providers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Career days with limited healthcare
representation, mentorship programs that can\'t reach scale, academic
pipeline programs starting too late (college)

**Arizona Context:** 58.5% of Arizona\'s rural students identify as
nonwhite. Only 22 of 100 Arizona K-12 students go on to college; only 6
obtain bachelor\'s degrees. Early exposure critical for diverse
healthcare pipeline.

**Global Context:** Minority healthcare workers more likely to practice
in underserved communities. Diversity improves cultural competence and
reduces disparities---WHO priority globally.

**Problem 11: Rural Healthcare Career Pathway Navigator**

**Problem Statement:** Only 29% of rural residents aged 18-24 enroll in
higher education versus 48% urban. Arizona has 29 areas with
population-to-physician ratios exceeding 5,000:1 or no physician at all.
Rural students lack clear pathways to healthcare careers.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Rural Arizona students, rural healthcare
facilities, tribal communities, community colleges serving rural areas

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic career counseling, programs
centered in Phoenix/Tucson inaccessible to rural students, limited
awareness of \"grow your own\" workforce models

**Arizona Context:** NAU\'s AZ Ahead program serves rural/tribal
communities. YES Program in Yuma shows 95% of participants likely to
earn degrees. ASU Health\'s statewide clinic network creates potential
training sites.

**Global Context:** Norway and Sweden have implemented \"distributed
medical education\" with training in rural communities. Task-shifting
models expand who can provide care.

**Problem 12: Community Health Worker Training Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Community Health Workers (CHWs) are critical for
reaching underserved populations but lack standardized training and
career pathways. Arizona\'s tribal communities have Community Health
Representatives, but training varies widely.

**Affected Stakeholders:** CHWs and CHRs, tribal health departments,
community health centers, underserved community members

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Employer-driven training without
standards, limited certification, high turnover due to lack of career
progression

**Arizona Context:** Arizona has 100+ Community Health Representatives
serving Navajo Nation alone. CHW programs could address rural/tribal
access gaps highlighted by ASU Health\'s focus on health equity.

**Global Context:** Brazil and Ethiopia have among world\'s largest CHW
programs with proven impact on vulnerable population health. ROI ranges
from 3:1 to 15:1 when properly implemented.

**Problem 13: Clinical Rotation Housing Finder**

**Problem Statement:** Nursing and medical students traveling to remote
clinical sites face average housing costs of \$3,495 per
student---creating financial barriers that disproportionately affect
lower-income students.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare students, clinical coordinators,
rural rotation sites, students from lower-income backgrounds

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Students find housing independently,
informal networks favor those with social capital, some sites
unavailable due to housing barriers

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s geographic spread means rural rotations
(critical for workforce distribution) often require temporary
relocation. Tribal sites particularly affected by limited nearby
housing.

**Global Context:** Medical schools in Australia and Canada have
implemented distributed housing networks for rural rotations with
success in improving rural workforce recruitment.

**Problem 14: School Nurse Workflow Optimizer**

**Problem Statement:** Fewer than 40% of public schools employ a
full-time RN. California\'s ratio is 2,410:1 versus the recommended
1:750. Nurses covering multiple schools can\'t be present for
emergencies, and non-medical staff dispense medications.

**Affected Stakeholders:** School nurses, students with chronic
conditions, school administrators, parents, children relying on school
nurse as only healthcare contact

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Nurses driving between schools,
delegating to unlicensed staff, reactive care when present

**Arizona Context:** Arizona does not mandate school nurses.
Lower-income districts less likely to have nursing support---affecting
college readiness for students with chronic conditions.

**Global Context:** School nursing ratios vary globally; countries with
national health systems often integrate school health more
systematically.

**Problem 15: Chronic Condition Student Support App**

**Problem Statement:** One in four students has a chronic illness
(asthma, diabetes). Chronic absenteeism due to health issues affects
educational outcomes, yet health management plans are often paper-based
and poorly communicated.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students with chronic conditions, parents,
school nurses, teachers, school administrators

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Paper health plans, poor parent-school
communication, teachers unaware of student needs, medication management
challenges

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s extreme heat exacerbates respiratory
conditions. Students from low-income families less likely to have care
coordinated between school and home.

**Global Context:** Digital health management for chronic conditions
shows improved adherence and outcomes across pediatric populations
globally.

**Problem 16: FAFSA Completion Assistant**

**Problem Statement:** Only 45.2% of Arizona 2025 high school graduates
completed FAFSA. FAFSA completion is linked to 127% increase in college
enrollment for low-income students---making this a critical pipeline
issue for both education and healthcare workforce development.

**Affected Stakeholders:** High school seniors, parents (especially
first-generation), school counselors, financial aid offices, future
employers needing educated workforce

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** FAFSA completion nights with limited
attendance, counselor time constraints, complex form intimidating
families

**Arizona Context:** Arizona has 225 FAFSA Peer Coaches in Maricopa/Pima
counties. College Ready AZ FAFSA Scholarship offers \$2,000 awards.
State ranked 6th in year-over-year improvement but still has 55%
unreached.

**Global Context:** Countries with simplified aid applications (like
UK\'s means-tested grants) show higher completion. Behavioral nudges
proven effective for aid completion.

**Problem 17: Clinical Reasoning Training Simulator with Diagnostic
Uncertainty**

**Problem Statement:** Medical diagnostic errors affect 12 million
Americans annually, with 40,000-80,000 deaths attributed to
misdiagnosis. Current clinical training emphasizes pattern recognition
toward \"correct\" diagnoses, but real medicine involves irreducible
uncertainty---multiple conditions present similarly, test results are
probabilistic, and patients don\'t present like textbooks. Students
graduate overconfident in clear-cut diagnoses and underprepared for
ambiguity.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Medical and nursing students, clinical
faculty, simulation center staff, patients who receive misdiagnoses,
malpractice systems, licensing boards assessing competency

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Case-based learning with predetermined
\"right answers,\" simulation mannequins with scripted responses, OSCEs
that reward confident diagnosis over uncertainty acknowledgment, limited
training on communicating diagnostic uncertainty to patients

**Arizona Context:** ASU Health\'s John Shufeldt School of Medicine aims
to create a \"new kind of physician\" integrating engineering thinking.
This requires calibrated confidence---knowing what you don\'t know.
Arizona\'s rural areas see delayed diagnosis due to limited specialist
access, making primary care uncertainty management critical.

**Global Context:** Dual-process theory research shows expert
diagnosticians use both intuitive pattern recognition and analytical
reasoning. Overconfidence bias is well-documented in medical
education---students become more confident but not more accurate as
training progresses. UK and Canadian medical schools are piloting
\"diagnostic uncertainty curricula.\"

**Education Operations**

**Problem 18: First-Generation Student Success Platform**

**Problem Statement:** 33% of ASU undergraduates are first-generation
students who lack family guidance navigating higher education. First-gen
students face higher attrition rates and lower graduation rates than
peers.

**Affected Stakeholders:** First-generation students, families, academic
advisors, retention teams, employers seeking diverse graduates

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic orientation programs,
mentorship matching with limited follow-through, services students
don\'t know exist

**Arizona Context:** 52% of transfer students at UA are
first-generation. 60% of Hispanic/Latino students in Arizona identify as
first-generation---and Hispanic students are now 50%+ of incoming
classes.

**Global Context:** First-generation challenges are universal but
intensity varies by system. Countries with stronger secondary-tertiary
alignment show better outcomes.

**Problem 19: Transfer Student Pathway Navigator**

**Problem Statement:** Transfer students face credit loss, advising
inconsistencies, and \"transfer shock\" affecting persistence. Despite
Arizona\'s AZTransfer system, many students lack awareness of optimal
pathways.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Community college students, transfer
advisors, university admissions, students losing credits/time

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Course-by-course equivalency searches,
inconsistent advising, MyPath2ASU exists but underutilized

**Arizona Context:** AZTransfer and AGEC provide foundation, but 10
Maricopa Community College districts mean varied advising quality. ASU
Online receives many transfer students.

**Global Context:** Transfer articulation challenges exist globally.
Best practices include guaranteed admission agreements and centralized
equivalency databases.

**Problem 20: Online Student Engagement Hub**

**Problem Statement:** ASU Online\'s 80,000+ students face unique
isolation challenges. Online students have lower retention rates and
report feeling disconnected from campus community.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Online students, online instructors, student
support services, ASU Online administration

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Discussion boards with low engagement,
generic virtual events, services designed for on-campus students

**Arizona Context:** ASU Online grew 9% in fall 2025 with 18,800 new
online students. Managing engagement at this scale while maintaining
quality is unprecedented.

**Global Context:** Hybrid models are \"permanent fixtures\" globally.
Research shows blended approaches outperform pure online---suggesting
integration opportunities.

**Problem 21: Gateway Course AI Tutor**

**Problem Statement:** High-enrollment gateway courses (math, science,
writing) have high failure rates that predict attrition. Faculty can\'t
provide personalized attention to hundreds of students.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students in gateway courses, faculty,
academic advisors, retention teams

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Large lectures, limited TA
availability, tutoring centers with capacity constraints

**Arizona Context:** ASU manages 194,000+ students across campuses and
online. AI-enhanced adaptive learning in gateway courses is already in
development but needs expansion.

**Global Context:** AI tutoring can be as effective as one-on-one human
tutoring. Squirrel AI in China showed students scoring 456% higher in
less time with AI-driven personalization.

**Problem 22: Student Financial Wellness App**

**Problem Statement:** Financial stress is a top-five stressor for
college students. Arizona\'s limited state-funded scholarships and
rising tuition create significant burden.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Students facing financial stress, financial
aid offices, retention teams, student emergency aid programs

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic financial literacy workshops,
complex scholarship searches, emergency aid with limited awareness

**Arizona Context:** ASU added \$350 tuition surcharge for spring 2025.
Arizona ranks 46th for state higher education support. University of
Northern Iowa reduced student debt by \$3,300 per borrower through
financial literacy programming.

**Global Context:** 73% of prospective students globally cite
affordability concerns. Financial barriers affect persistence across all
countries with tuition-based systems.

**Problem 23: Faculty Workload Equity Dashboard**

**Problem Statement:** Faculty face heavy teaching loads with multiple
courses, large classes, and diverse student needs. Balancing teaching,
research, and service creates burnout, but workload distribution is
often opaque.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Faculty, department chairs, provost offices,
students affected by burned-out instructors

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Self-reported workload tracking,
inequitable distribution, limited visibility into actual demands

**Arizona Context:** ASU\'s faculty student ratio is 18:1 with 5,400+
faculty members. Growth pressures increase reliance on adjuncts. Cost of
living in Phoenix affects recruitment/retention.

**Global Context:** Faculty burnout is global phenomenon---majority of
physicians across 10 countries report burnout. Half of older physicians
plan to stop seeing patients within three years.

**Problem 24: Adjunct Faculty Support Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Universities increasingly rely on
adjunct/part-time faculty who often teach at multiple institutions, lack
benefits, and have limited access to support resources.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Adjunct faculty, full-time faculty taking on
advising load, students taught by under-supported instructors

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Per-course contracts with limited
integration, separate onboarding at each institution, minimal
professional development

**Arizona Context:** ASU\'s growth has increased adjunct reliance.
Community colleges heavily use adjuncts. Competition from gig economy
and industry.

**Global Context:** Adjunctification is a global trend in higher
education, raising quality and equity concerns across systems.

**Problem 25: Research Grant Matching Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Faculty spend significant time searching for
funding opportunities. Competition for grants is fierce, and application
processes are complex. Matching researchers to appropriate opportunities
is inefficient.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Research faculty, sponsored programs offices,
graduate students dependent on research funding

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic funding databases, manual
searches, missed deadlines, duplicated effort across institutions

**Arizona Context:** State funding cuts mean universities increasingly
depend on external research funding. ASU Health\'s Mayo Clinic
partnership includes seed grant programs.

**Global Context:** Research funding competition is intense globally.
AI-powered grant matching is emerging but not yet widespread.

**Problem 26: Student Support Request Triage**

**Problem Statement:** Staff are overwhelmed by student requests, many
of which could be addressed through self-service or AI. High volumes
prevent staff from helping students with complex needs.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Student services staff, students with urgent
needs, supervisors managing capacity

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Email queues with long response times,
phone holds, students giving up before getting help

**Arizona Context:** ASU\'s scale means support staff serve massive
student populations. 42,900 new students enrolled fall 2025 alone.

**Global Context:** AI chatbots for student services are expanding
globally. Best implementations triage to humans for complex issues.

**Problem 27: Cross-Department Coordination Tool**

**Problem Statement:** Staff members juggle multiple roles and
coordinate across departments with different systems. Students
experience fragmented services as a result.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Staff across departments, students navigating
multiple offices, administrators seeking efficiency

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Siloed systems, manual handoffs,
students repeating information to multiple offices

**Arizona Context:** ASU\'s complexity (four campuses plus online) means
students may interact with many departments. Integration challenges
amplified by scale.

**Global Context:** Student success management platforms are growing
globally, but integration with existing systems remains challenging.

**Problem 28: K-12 Partnership Coordination Dashboard**

**Problem Statement:** Universities partner with K-12 districts but
coordination is fragmented. Programs duplicate effort while leaving
gaps. Only 22 of 100 Arizona K-12 students go to college; only 6 obtain
bachelor\'s degrees.

**Affected Stakeholders:** K-12 students, school counselors, university
outreach staff, communities with low college-going rates

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Scattered programs, inconsistent
contact across districts, limited data on what works

**Arizona Context:** Arizona ranks 45th nationally in Pre-K-12
education. Wide variation in outcomes---students at top 10% of schools
have \~50% college completion vs. \<10% at bottom 60%.

**Global Context:** Countries with strong secondary-tertiary alignment
(like Finland) show better transition outcomes. Data-sharing between
sectors improves targeting.

**Problem 29: Employer Skills Alignment Tool**

**Problem Statement:** 85% of employers claim skills-based hiring, but
only 0.14% of actual hires were affected by degree requirement removals.
Skills-based language isn\'t translating to hiring outcomes.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Graduates seeking employment, career
services, employers, curriculum developers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Generic career services, job boards
focused on degree requirements, limited employer-education dialogue
about actual skills

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s semiconductor boom (TSMC\'s \$65+
billion investment) creates acute skills needs. 140,000+
semiconductor-relevant jobs in Phoenix metro need trained workers.

**Global Context:** Companies succeeding at skills-based hiring hired
18% more non-degreed workers with 10% higher retention. Technical roles
filled 40% faster using skills-first approaches.

**Problem 30: Microcredential Stackable Pathway Designer**

**Problem Statement:** Students want flexible pathways that provide
value along the way. 36.8 million Americans have \"some college, no
credential.\" Microcredentials could provide value but pathways are
unclear.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Adult learners, students needing flexibility,
employers seeking specific skills, credential evaluators

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Standalone certificates without clear
stacking, employer unfamiliarity with microcredentials, transcript
limitations

**Arizona Context:** Arizona community colleges now offer bachelor\'s
degrees. Maricopa Accelerated Semiconductor Training (MAST) shows
industry-aligned credential demand.

**Global Context:** 76% of trade school graduates believe skills-based
education worth the cost. Stackable credentials growing globally as
alternative pathways.

**Problem 31: Sustainability and Climate Impact Tracker**

**Problem Statement:** Universities face pressure to reduce
environmental impact and prepare students for climate challenges.
Arizona faces extreme heat, drought, and wildfire risks affecting campus
operations.

**Affected Stakeholders:** University operations, students concerned
about climate, surrounding communities, future generations

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Scattered sustainability initiatives,
limited visibility into progress, climate adaptation planning reactive

**Arizona Context:** ASU ranks top 10 globally for UN Sustainable
Development Goals. Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory addresses
water sustainability. Extreme heat affects outdoor activities and
building energy use.

**Global Context:** Health sector responsible for \~5% of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Universities globally moving toward carbon
neutrality commitments.

**Problem 32: Rural Student Virtual Campus Experience**

**Problem Statement:** 13+ million Americans live in \"education
deserts.\" Rural Arizona students lack exposure to campus life that
influences enrollment and persistence decisions.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Rural prospective students, admissions
offices, rural high school counselors, families

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Physical campus visits require travel,
virtual tours are passive, limited personalization

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s vast rural areas exceed most
comparisons. Limited broadband affects video quality. 29% of rural
residents aged 18-24 enrolled in higher education versus 48% urban.

**Global Context:** VR campus tours are expanding globally. Best
practices combine technology with human connection (virtual student
ambassadors).

**Problem 33: Equity Gap Identifier and Intervention Router**

**Problem Statement:** Educational institutions collect vast data on
student outcomes but struggle to translate disparities into actionable
interventions. Achievement gaps persist across race, income,
first-generation status, and geography---but knowing a gap exists
differs from knowing why it exists or what to do about it. Current
dashboards show disparities without diagnosing root causes or routing to
evidence-based interventions.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Underperforming student populations,
institutional research offices, academic advisors, diversity/equity
offices, accreditors requiring equity metrics, faculty teaching gateway
courses, community partners

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Static equity dashboards showing gaps
without causation, annual reports that don\'t drive action, generic
\"support services\" not tailored to specific gap drivers, interventions
applied uniformly rather than targeted to identified causes

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s demographic shifts mean Hispanic
students are now 50%+ of incoming classes---making equity gaps
increasingly consequential for overall institutional outcomes. ASU\'s
charter commitment to \"those to whom it may not have been historically
available\" demands moving beyond identifying gaps to closing them. The
22-of-100 K-12-to-degree completion rate masks vast variation by
community.

**Global Context:** Evidence-based education interventions exist but
adoption is slow. Randomized controlled trials in education remain rare.
UK\'s What Works Clearinghouse and similar repositories catalog
interventions but don\'t match to local contexts. Precision education
(targeting interventions based on individual characteristics) is
emerging but not at scale.

**Healthcare Workforce Solutions**

**Problem 34: Healthcare Worker Burnout Detection**

**Problem Statement:** 3 in 10 healthcare workers considered leaving the
profession; 6 in 10 said the pandemic harmed their mental health. Half
of physicians 55+ plan to stop seeing patients within three years.
Burnout detection happens too late.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare workers, patients receiving care
from burned-out providers, healthcare administrators, families of
workers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Annual surveys missing real-time
issues, reactive wellness programs, stigma around seeking help

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s severe workforce shortage means
burned-out workers can\'t be easily replaced. Rural and tribal
facilities especially vulnerable to departures.

**Global Context:** Commonwealth Fund finds majority of primary care
doctors across 10 countries report burnout. Younger physicians more
affected---threatening future workforce.

**Problem 35: Smart Scheduling for Healthcare Shifts**

**Problem Statement:** Healthcare scheduling often creates inequitable
workloads, last-minute changes, and burnout. Staff feel they have no
control over their lives outside work.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Nurses, physicians, scheduling coordinators,
patients affected by short-staffing

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Manual scheduling, seniority-based
systems that burden newer workers, limited consideration of worker
preferences

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s staffing shortages mean remaining
workers absorb extra shifts. Travel nurse reliance creates scheduling
complexity.

**Global Context:** AI-powered scheduling optimization shows promise in
reducing burnout while maintaining coverage. Shared Medical Appointments
model extends provider capacity.

**Problem 36: Preceptor Recognition and Support Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Clinical preceptors who train students do so on
top of patient care duties with limited recognition or compensation.
This limits willingness to precept, creating placement shortages.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Clinical preceptors, healthcare students,
nursing/medical schools, healthcare facilities

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Occasional appreciation events, some
CME credit, limited financial incentive

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s \$25 million preceptor training
investment aims to add 1,145 new preceptors. Creating sustainable
recognition systems extends this investment\'s impact.

**Global Context:** Countries with formal preceptor recognition systems
show higher willingness to train students. Micro-credentials for
preceptors emerging.

**Problem 37: Healthcare Workforce Retention Forecaster**

**Problem Statement:** Healthcare facilities operate reactively to
turnover---scrambling to fill positions after resignations rather than
intervening before departure. Arizona loses an estimated
\$50,000-\$100,000 per nurse turnover in recruitment and training costs,
yet predictable warning signs (schedule changes, reduced engagement,
peer departures) go unmonitored. The healthcare workforce crisis isn\'t
just about recruitment; it\'s about retention of existing workers who
leave preventable departures.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Healthcare workers considering departure, HR
departments, nurse managers, hospital CFOs, patients affected by
staffing instability, remaining staff absorbing workload from vacancies,
healthcare workforce researchers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Exit interviews (too late), annual
engagement surveys (too infrequent and aggregated), turnover dashboards
showing historical rates without prediction, reactive retention bonuses
offered after notice given, generic wellness programs not targeted to
at-risk individuals

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s 28,100 projected nursing shortage by
2025 (worst in nation) means every preventable departure compounds the
crisis. Rural and tribal facilities face 2-3x higher turnover than urban
hospitals. The \$25 million preceptor investment is wasted if trained
preceptors leave. ASU Health\'s new workforce entering practice needs
retention systems from day one.

**Global Context:** Turnover prediction models from other industries
(tech, retail) show 70-80% accuracy 90 days before departure.
Healthcare-specific models are emerging but not deployed at scale. NHS
in UK experimented with \"flight risk\" dashboards. Scandinavian
countries show lower healthcare turnover through system-level
interventions (workload caps, schedule predictability).

**Patient Care & Public Health**

**Problem 38: Heat Vulnerability Early Warning System**

**Problem Statement:** Arizona\'s heat-related deaths increased 1,000%
since 2010s. Maricopa County recorded 645 deaths in 2023. Current
interventions are reactive rather than predictive.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Vulnerable individuals (homeless, elderly,
outdoor workers), public health departments, emergency services,
families of victims

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Cooling centers often closed when
still dangerous (nights/weekends), welfare checks are
resource-intensive, high-risk individuals unknown until crisis

**Arizona Context:** 49% of heat deaths involved homeless individuals.
57% involved substance use. Health Observatory launched Arizona Social
Vulnerability Index in October 2024 for better targeting.

**Global Context:** Heat vulnerability indices exist globally but
predictive models combining weather, individual risk, and intervention
capacity are emerging. WHO projects 250,000 additional climate-related
deaths annually by 2030.

**Problem 39: Senior Fall Prevention and Detection**

**Problem Statement:** Falls are a leading cause of injury and death
among older adults. 1.5 million Arizonans are over 60, and many live
alone. Falls often go undetected until serious.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Seniors aging in place, family caregivers,
home health workers, emergency services

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Medical alert buttons require user
activation, wearables with limited adoption, family checking in
reactively

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s large retiree population faces
heat-related fall risk (dehydration affects balance). Many live in
sprawling communities far from family.

**Global Context:** AI-powered fall detection is advancing rapidly.
Japan and Nordic countries lead in senior living technology due to aging
demographics.

**Problem 40: Medication Adherence for Chronic Conditions**

**Problem Statement:** Only about 50% of patients take medications as
prescribed. Non-adherence causes 125,000+ deaths and costs \$100-300
billion annually in the US.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Patients with chronic conditions, family
caregivers, pharmacists, healthcare providers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Pill organizers, pharmacy reminders
ignored, complex regimens for multiple conditions

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s aging population faces polypharmacy
challenges. One in three Navajo are diabetic or pre-diabetic, requiring
consistent medication management.

**Global Context:** Digital adherence tools show promise but face
adoption barriers. Simplest interventions (text reminders) often most
effective.

**Problem 41: Rural Telehealth Optimization**

**Problem Statement:** Telehealth could solve rural access, but 33% of
tribal reservation residents only have smartphone internet. Low
bandwidth makes video visits unreliable.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Rural patients, providers offering
telehealth, tribal communities, elderly with limited tech skills

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Video visits require high bandwidth,
asynchronous options limited, technical support unavailable

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s rural and tribal communities face severe
provider shortages. ASU Health\'s statewide clinic network could anchor
telehealth expansion.

**Global Context:** Sweden\'s \"virtual community rooms\" provide 24/7
self-monitoring access. Norway achieves 100% regional telehealth
adoption with appropriate technology matching.

**Problem 42: Opioid Overdose Prediction Dashboard**

**Problem Statement:** Arizona drug overdose death rate is 36 per
100,000---14% above national average. Fentanyl accounts for 60% of drug
deaths with a 4,900% increase since 2015. More than 5 people die daily.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Individuals with substance use disorders,
families, first responders, public health departments, naloxone
distribution programs

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Reactive overdose response, naloxone
distribution without targeting, limited real-time surveillance

**Arizona Context:** Health Observatory launched machine learning model
to predict overdose death risk in January 2025---hackathon teams could
extend or apply this work.

**Global Context:** Harm reduction approaches show success in Portugal
and other countries. AI prediction models emerging for overdose risk
stratification.

**Problem 43: Bilingual Health Navigation for Border Communities**

**Problem Statement:** 187.8 million northbound border crossings occur
at Arizona-Mexico border annually. Border communities face elevated
infectious disease rates, farmworker health needs, and binational care
coordination challenges.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Border community residents, migrant
populations, farmworkers, binational families, community health centers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Language barriers in healthcare,
fragmented binational coordination, insurance complications for
cross-border care

**Arizona Context:** Yuma and Santa Cruz counties have 100% of
populations in HPSAs. Agricultural workers face pesticide exposure and
heat illness requiring culturally-competent care.

**Global Context:** Border health programs exist worldwide. EU has
frameworks for cross-border care coordination that could inform
US-Mexico approaches.

**Problem 44: Tribal Health Cultural Adaptation Platform**

**Problem Statement:** Native Americans experience 2.5x higher
psychological distress than general population. Traditional healing
practices aren\'t reimbursable by Medicaid. Health interventions often
fail due to cultural mismatch.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Tribal community members, traditional
healers, Community Health Representatives, IHS facilities

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Western health apps without cultural
adaptation, generic interventions ignoring traditional knowledge, Navajo
language support lacking

**Arizona Context:** Arizona is home to 22 federally recognized tribes.
Navajo Nation spans 27,000 square miles with 350,000+ enrolled members.
One in three Navajo families live without piped water or electricity.

**Global Context:** WHO emphasizes culturally-appropriate care.
Indigenous health programs in Australia and Canada show better outcomes
when community-designed.

**Problem 45: Valley Fever Early Detection**

**Problem Statement:** Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis) is endemic to
Arizona, caused by inhaling fungal spores from desert soil. Climate
change and construction are increasing exposure.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Arizona residents, outdoor workers,
construction workers, healthcare providers often unfamiliar with
diagnosis

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Frequently misdiagnosed as pneumonia,
limited public awareness, surveillance gaps

**Arizona Context:** Health Observatory is researching Valley Fever by
integrating weather, land cover, and environmental data with air filter
data---hackathon teams could build on this.

**Global Context:** Climate change is expanding range of soil-dwelling
pathogens globally. Early warning systems emerging for environmental
health threats.

**Healthcare Administration & Data**

**Problem 46: Hospital Capacity Real-Time Dashboard**

**Problem Statement:** During COVID-19, Arizona created the Surge Line
to transfer 5,500+ patients from overwhelmed facilities. No centralized
capacity visibility existed before the pandemic.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Hospital administrators, emergency services,
patients needing transfer, public health departments

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Phone calls between facilities, manual
reporting, delayed visibility into system status

**Arizona Context:** Arizona Surge Line transferred patients during
COVID, with 90% from rural facilities. AI/AN populations
disproportionately transferred. Infrastructure should be maintained for
future surges.

**Global Context:** Hungary\'s mobile healthcare units coordinate
through real-time dashboards. Centralized bed management shows improved
patient flow in European systems.

**Problem 47: Health Data Interoperability Connector**

**Problem Statement:** Patient data is fragmented across providers.
Patients repeat their history at every visit. Care coordination suffers
when providers lack complete information.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Patients, primary care providers,
specialists, emergency departments, care coordinators

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Patient portals at each provider,
fax-based records transfer, manual data entry

**Arizona Context:** ASU Health\'s \"learning health ecosystem\"
requires data flow across partners. Health Observatory needs integrated
data for analytics.

**Global Context:** Nordic countries have national health information
exchanges. US lags in interoperability despite decades of effort.

**Problem 48: AI-Assisted Clinical Documentation**

**Problem Statement:** Clinicians spend up to 50% of their time on
documentation. Documentation burden contributes to burnout and takes
time from patient care.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Physicians, nurses, medical scribes, patients
receiving shorter visits

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Manual documentation, templates with
limited personalization, scribes expensive and not scalable

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s workforce shortage means documentation
burden falls on fewer workers. Reducing administrative burden is a top
opportunity identified by ASU Health.

**Global Context:** Microsoft Dragon Copilot, Google\'s healthcare AI
suite, and similar tools are transforming clinical documentation
globally. FDA has approved 1,300+ AI-enabled medical devices.

**Problem 49: Patient Transportation Coordination**

**Problem Statement:** 14.1% of Arizona adults report medical costs as
barrier to care. Transportation is often the actual barrier---patients
can\'t get to appointments, especially in rural areas.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Patients without transportation, elderly
patients, rural residents, healthcare facilities experiencing no-shows

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Medicaid transportation programs with
complex requirements, volunteer driver programs with limited capacity,
missed appointments costly for patients and providers

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s vast geography means some rural
residents travel 100+ miles for specialty care. Heat makes waiting for
rides dangerous.

**Global Context:** UK NHS has non-emergency patient transport.
Ride-share medical transportation partnerships growing but not
universal.

**Problem 50: Caregiver Support and Respite Finder**

**Problem Statement:** 870,000 family caregivers in Arizona provide
unpaid care. Caregiver burnout affects both caregiver health and care
quality. Respite options are limited and hard to find.

**Affected Stakeholders:** Family caregivers, care recipients, Area
Agencies on Aging, respite care providers

**Current Inadequate Solutions:** Scattered respite programs, long
waitlists, caregivers unaware of available support

**Arizona Context:** Arizona\'s aging population creates growing
caregiver needs. Limited adult day services and respite options,
especially outside Phoenix/Tucson metros.

**Global Context:** Countries with formal caregiver support systems
(Germany, Netherlands) show better caregiver health outcomes. Digital
platforms connecting caregivers to respite emerging.
