Welcome, Innovator

You\'re about to spend 2.5 days building solutions to real challenges in
education and healthcare---with teammates you\'ve never worked with,
using a framework that puts ethics at the center of innovation. This
isn\'t a typical hackathon. You\'ll walk away with a prototype, yes, but
also with experience navigating ambiguity, collaborating across
disciplines, and thinking critically about the impact of what you build.

**Let\'s get to work.**

Principled Innovation (PI)

PI is at the heart of this hackathon. You\'ll attend a 2-hour workshop
on Day 1 that grounds everything you build. The core idea: design
solutions that work *for* people, not just *at* problems. Judges will
look for evidence of ethical reasoning throughout your project.

The 7 Guiding Principles

1.  **Understanding Context** --- Who\'s affected? What\'s their history
    and experience?

2.  **Reflecting Throughout** --- Pause. Check assumptions. Revisit
    decisions.

3.  **Connecting to Stakeholders** --- Build relationships. Find common
    goals.

4.  **Inquiring Deeply** --- Research root causes. Seek diverse
    perspectives.

5.  **Imagining Possibilities** --- Generate creative solutions.
    Consider consequences.

6.  **Iterating by Action** --- Test ideas. Gather feedback. Refine.

7.  **Communicating Throughout** --- Share learnings, progress, and
    outcomes.

What Judges Look For

Strong projects will:

-   Name at least 3 PI principles you applied

-   Identify specific ethical considerations for your problem/solution

-   Consider multiple stakeholder perspectives

-   Show a design decision influenced by ethical reasoning

-   Discuss potential unintended consequences and mitigations

How You\'ll Be Judged

**Binary scoring** (1 = meets criterion, 0 = doesn\'t) across 26 points:

  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------
  Problem Definition                            **3 pts**

  **Principled Innovation**                     **5 pts**

  Solution Design                               **3 pts**

  Technical Implementation                      **4 pts**

  Execution Quality                             **3 pts**

  Presentation Quality                          **3 pts**

  Impact Potential                              **3 pts**

  Team Collaboration                            **2 pts**
  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------

**Threshold:** Teams below 10 points are ineligible for finalist
selection. **Finalist selection:** Judge scores (80%) + Peer votes
(20%).

Problem Bank

*[N] Challenges in [Domain]*

Your team will select one problem from the curated problem bank. For each problem, you
will:

1.  Identify ethical considerations using the [ethical framework]

2.  Design and build a prototype solution

3.  Present your work to judges and peers

See `problem-bank/problem-bank.md` for the full set of problems. Each problem includes:
problem statement, affected stakeholders, current inadequate solutions, regional context,
global context, ethical considerations, and prototype scope.

[Paste or link your problem bank here when distributing to participants.]
