**Introduction**

This document outlines the ScaleU + Principled Innovation Academy
Hackathon 2026, a three-day, in-person experience where students
collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to design innovative solutions to
real challenges in higher education and healthcare, grounded in ethical
reasoning and the Principled Innovation framework.

This hackathon emphasizes learning, impact, and responsible innovation
over pure competition. Participants will integrate ethical
considerations into every stage of development, working with assigned
teammates to navigate complex problem-solving under time constraints.

The convergence of Arizona\'s healthcare workforce crisis, ASU Health\'s
launch, and rapidly evolving educational technology creates an
unprecedented opportunity for student innovation. This hackathon
addresses challenges where 2.5-day prototypes can demonstrate meaningful
impact across education and health sectors.

**Registration Process**

**Eligibility**

Open to all current ASU students (undergraduate and graduate) enrolled
at any ASU campus. No prior hackathon experience required.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR PRIZE ELIGIBILITY:** To receive prize
payments, winners must be enrolled in at least one credit at ASU during
Spring 2026 semester. Prize payments are processed through ASU student
accounts and require active enrollment status. Non-enrolled participants
may compete but are ineligible for prizes.

**Registration Timeline**

-   **Registration opens:** January 15, 2026

-   **Registration closes:** January 29, 2026, 11:59 PM Arizona Time

-   **Team assignments sent:** January 30, 2026

-   **Event begins:** February 2, 2026, 8:30 AM

**Selection Process**

**First-come, first-served:** The first 100 completed registrations will
be accepted. Once 100 participants are confirmed, the registration
portal will close automatically.

**Team Formation**

**Team Assignment Process**

All participants will be assigned to teams of 4 using a stratified
random assignment process. This process optimizes for team viability
while introducing productive diversity.

**Assignment Constraints**

**Hard Constraints (must satisfy):**

-   Each team has exactly 4 members

-   Each team has at least 1 person who identified as \"technical\"

-   Each team has a mix of hackathon experience levels

**No Team Changes Policy**

Team assignments are final except in circumstances of participant
withdrawal, Code of Conduct violations, or participant no-show on Day 1.
Learning to navigate team dynamics is a core objective of this
hackathon.

**Rules**

1.  **Team Composition:** All teams consist of exactly 4 members,
    pre-assigned by organizers. Team changes are not permitted except
    for withdrawal or Code of Conduct violations.

2.  **Participant Eligibility:** All team members must be registered
    participants. Organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, and mentors
    cannot compete.

3.  **Problem Selection:** Teams must select from the curated problem
    bank of 47 challenges.

4.  **Development Work:** Teams may discuss ideas before Day 1 but
    cannot write code or create artifacts. At least 60% of the
    project\'s codebase must be original, created during the hackathon.

5.  **Development Deadline:** All development must cease at 5:00 PM on
    Day 2. All deliverables must be submitted via Airtable form.

6.  **Submission Requirements:** Pitch deck (PDF or PowerPoint), link to
    working demo, and GitHub repository link. Incomplete submissions
    will be ineligible for prizes.

7.  **Principled Innovation Requirement:** All projects must explicitly
    integrate PI framework. PI integration is a mandatory judging
    criterion.

8.  **Academic Integrity:** Plagiarism or misrepresentation of work will
    result in disqualification. AI code generation tools are allowed but
    must be disclosed.

9.  **Disqualification Grounds:** Violation of Code of Conduct,
    competition rules, unsporting behavior, or failure to submit
    required materials.

10. **Organizer Discretion:** Organizers reserve the right to make final
    decisions on rule interpretations.

**Judging Process**

**Phase 1: Table Showcase and Voting**

**Timing:** Day 3, 10:00 AM - 12:30 PM (2.5 hours)

5 judges will circulate among all 25 tables during the showcase period.
Each judge will visit all 25 teams (approximately 5-6 minutes per team),
ask clarifying questions, and evaluate teams using standardized rubric.

**Finalist Selection**

During the 12:30 PM - 1:00 PM lunch period, judges will normalize
scores, integrate peer voting results (20% weight), calculate composite
scores, and select top 5 finalists.

**Phase 2: Finalist Presentations**

**Timing:** Day 3, 1:15 PM - 2:45 PM (90 minutes)

5 finalists present on stage to full audience. 15 minutes per team: 10
minutes presentation, 3 minutes Q&A, 2 minutes transition. Winners
announced at 2:45 PM.

**Scoring Interpretation**

-   **20-26 points:** Exceptional project demonstrating strong PI
    integration, technical execution, and impact potential

-   **15-19 points:** Strong project with minor gaps in PI application
    or technical execution

-   **10-14 points:** Adequate project meeting baseline requirements but
    lacking depth

-   **0-9 points:** Project fails to meet mandatory requirements

**MANDATORY THRESHOLD:** Teams scoring below 10 points are ineligible
for finalist selection regardless of peer vote results.

**Principled Innovation Framework**

**Day 1 Principled Innovation Workshop**

On Day 1 from 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM, [PI Workshop Lead Name] (Program Director,
Principled Innovation Academy) will lead all teams through a structured
PI workshop designed to ground problem-solving in ethical reasoning from
the start.

**Workshop Structure**

-   **Activity 1: Community Agreement** - Establish team norms for
    collaboration

-   **Activity 2: Problem Framing** - Examine root causes, cluster
    ideas, identify assumptions

-   **Activity 3: Empathy Mapping** - Map stakeholders, understand pain
    points from multiple perspectives

-   **Activity 4: Ideation** - Generate solution approaches using \"How
    Might We\" framing

**Seven Guiding Principles**

11. **Understanding Context:** Consider language, culture, history,
    experiences of affected communities

12. **Reflecting Throughout the Design Process:** Take time to reflect
    on context, process, and perspectives

13. **Connecting to Context and Stakeholders:** Build relationships and
    identify common goals

14. **Inquiring to Understand the Problem More Deeply:** Conduct
    research, identify root causes, seek diverse perspectives

15. **Imagining to Explore What Could Be:** Generate creative solutions,
    consider consequences

16. **Iterating by Taking Action:** Test ideas, gather feedback, refine
    solutions

17. **Communicating Throughout:** Share learnings, progress, and
    outcomes

**Minimum PI Integration Requirements**

To meet the mandatory PI threshold, your project must:

18. Explicitly name at least 3 PI guiding principles applied during your
    process

19. Identify specific ethical considerations relevant to your
    problem/solution

20. Demonstrate consideration of multiple stakeholder perspectives

21. Discuss at least one design decision where ethical considerations
    influenced technical choices

22. Articulate potential unintended consequences and mitigation
    strategies

**Support Systems**

**Mentor Office Hours**

-   **Day 1:** 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM

-   **Day 2:** 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM

**Mentor Expertise Areas**

-   Technical implementation and software development

-   Education sector domain knowledge

-   Health sector domain knowledge

-   Product design and user experience

-   Principled Innovation framework application

-   Pitch and presentation skills

**Team Dynamics Intervention**

Given the pre-assigned team structure, team dysfunction is expected in
some cases. Organizers will provide structured support rather than
allowing teams to dissolve. Teams experiencing significant conflict will
receive 1-on-1 conversations with organizers.
