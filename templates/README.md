# Templates

The four documents you need to run a hackathon. These are operational — hand them to participants, mentors, and judges.

## Files

**`design-document.md`** — The event blueprint. Covers schedule, registration, team formation algorithm, rules, judging process, PI framework integration, and support systems. This is the organizer's master document. Start here when planning your event.

**`student-guide.md`** — The participant-facing guide. Includes schedule, judging rubric, mentor station directory (with expertise areas and availability), rules, and what to bring. Distributed to students before or at check-in.

**`evaluation-criteria.md`** — The 26-point binary scoring rubric. Eight dimensions: problem definition (3 pts), principled innovation (5 pts, mandatory), solution design (3 pts), technical implementation (4 pts), execution quality (3 pts), presentation quality (3 pts), impact potential (3 pts), team collaboration (2 pts). Ready to hand to judges.

**`mentor-briefing.md`** — One-page brief for mentors. Station descriptions, PI framework context, Arizona healthcare background data, logistics. Designed to be read in 5 minutes before a shift.

## Adaptation Notes

- Replace `[Event Lead Name]` / `[PI Workshop Lead Name]` and email placeholders with your organizer contacts
- Replace `[Campus Police Number]` with your institution's emergency line
- Replace `[event-website]` and `[#event-slack-channel]` with your communication channels
- The mentor directory in the student guide uses `[Mentor N]` placeholders — populate with your mentor roster
- The schedule, rules, and rubric are transferable with minimal changes
