Context

Teams are pre-assigned (strangers working together). They selected
problems from a curated bank of 47 challenges across education and
healthcare. Principled Innovation integration is a mandatory judging
criterion---teams must demonstrate ethical reasoning, not just technical
execution.

Day 1: Teams are scoping and starting builds. Day 2: Teams are
debugging, refining, and preparing pitches (submission deadline 5:00
PM).

Principled Innovation (Required)

Teams must explicitly integrate PI into their projects. Judges evaluate:
stakeholder consideration, ethical implications identified, design
decisions influenced by ethical reasoning, unintended consequences
addressed.

**The 7 Principles:** Understanding Context, Reflecting Throughout,
Connecting to Stakeholders, Inquiring Deeply, Imagining Possibilities,
Iterating by Action, Communicating Throughout

**Common ethical flags:** Healthcare---HIPAA, patient safety, clinical
validity, health equity. Education---FERPA, access equity, surveillance
vs. support, accessibility.

Arizona Healthcare Context

Many problems reference Arizona-specific challenges:

• Nursing shortage: 28,100 projected shortfall by 2025 (worst in nation)

• 22 federally recognized tribes; Navajo Nation spans 27,000 sq mi

• Heat vulnerability: 645 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County (2023)

• Rural access: 29 areas with physician ratios \>5,000:1 or no physician

• Border health: 187.8M annual northbound crossings at AZ-Mexico border
