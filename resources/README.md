# Resources

Post-hackathon pathways for teams that want to continue building their prototypes into ventures.

## Files

**`entrepreneurship-resources.md`** — A comprehensive guide to ASU's and Arizona's entrepreneurship ecosystem for student ventures. Covers accelerators, funding competitions, maker spaces, healthcare-specific programs, and state-level support.

This document is highly institution-specific. It's included as an example of the kind of resource guide you should create for your own participants. The structure is transferable:

1. **Primary entry point** — The main student entrepreneurship program (Venture Devils at ASU)
2. **Funding competitions** — Demo Day, pitch competitions, grant programs
3. **Sector-specific accelerators** — Healthcare (HEALab), social impact (Changemaker Central)
4. **Free prototyping facilities** — Maker spaces, fabrication labs
5. **External accelerators** — Non-university programs (SEED SPOT)
6. **Industry ecosystem** — Clinical validation pathways, industry associations
7. **State/government programs** — Innovation challenges, SBIR support
8. **Key dates and immediate next steps** — Time-bound action items

## Adaptation Notes

Create an equivalent document for your institution. The key insight: students need a clear "what's next" pathway within days of the hackathon ending, or momentum dies. The most important element is a single, obvious first step (for us: "join Venture Devils now").
