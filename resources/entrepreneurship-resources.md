## Start here: Venture Devils is the essential first step

**Venture Devils** is ASU's flagship student entrepreneurship program and should be every founder's first stop after completing a hackathon prototype. Run by the J. Orin Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute, the program offers mentorship from **40+ experienced entrepreneurs**, co-working space at multiple campuses, educational workshops, and most critically—access to funding competitions.

The program accepts applications year-round via a **15-minute submission form** at entrepreneurship.asu.edu/programs/venture-devils/. Response time is typically a few weeks. The **Spring 2026 Demo Day deadline is March 1, 2026**, and students must join Venture Devils to qualify for pitch competition entry.

Eligibility is intentionally broad: any undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, or part-time student enrolled in a degree-seeking program at ASU or Maricopa Community College qualifies. All majors are welcome. The only restriction is that ventures cannot have previously received more than **$50,000 in funding** from external sources.

Once enrolled, founders receive a matched Venture Mentor based on industry expertise, access to "Pitch In" sessions every 2nd and 4th Wednesday for real-time feedback, and entry to the broader E+I community including the Blackstone LaunchPad partnership, which provides **paid internship opportunities at startups** paying $20+/hour.

## Demo Day offers $250,000+ across multiple funding tracks

The bi-annual **Demo Day** held each fall and spring semester at SkySong represents the primary funding mechanism for student ventures. Over **$250,000** is distributed across multiple named funding tracks, several of which specifically target health and social impact ventures.

**Funding tracks relevant to healthcare and education prototypes:**

The **Edson Student Entrepreneur Initiative** awards up to **$40,000** for early-stage student ventures and represents the largest single funding opportunity. The **Edson E+I MedTech Venture Challenge** specifically targets medical and health technology projects with **$10,000** for first place. The **Social Impact Challenge** funds mission-driven ventures addressing societal problems. The **eSeed Challenge**, powered by the Prescott Student Venture Fund, operates in three phases: Phase 1 awards **$1,000+** for hypothesis validation to 30+ startups; Phase 2 provides **$5,000+** accelerator grants; Phase 3 invites top founders to become ASU Tech Devils with all-expenses-paid innovation retreats.

Additional tracks include the **Sarsam Family Venture Challenge** (up to $15,000), **Hool Coury Law Tech Venture Challenge** (up to $20,000 for tech startups), **Ashton Family Venture Challenge** ($10,000), and **Good Work Capital Challenge** ($10,000).

## HEALab provides dedicated support for healthcare ventures

Students with health-focused prototypes should immediately connect with **HEALab (Health Entrepreneurship Accelerator Lab)**, ASU's accelerator focused exclusively on health and healthcare solutions. Located primarily at **850 PBC on the Phoenix Bioscience Campus**, HEALab is a collaboration between the Edson E+I Institute, Edson College of Nursing, College of Health Solutions, and New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences.

HEALab requires **no formal application**—students of any major simply email healab@asu.edu to get involved.

Notable alumni include Navi Nurses, Melts medical device, and SonoBuddy.

For more advanced health ventures, the **Mayo Clinic-ASU MedTech Accelerator** offers a multi-day immersive curriculum in healthcare entrepreneurship with access to Mayo Clinic clinicians, regulatory pathway guidance, and commercialization tools. While the main program targets companies that have raised at least $500,000 in seed capital, **ASU students can participate as interns** paired with cohort companies—an excellent pathway for students seeking clinical validation and industry mentorship. The next immersion runs **March 15-26, 2026**. Contact [Program Contact] or visit healthcareaccel.com.

## Changemaker Central funds social impact and education ventures

For education-focused and mission-driven prototypes, **ASU Changemaker Central** offers the most direct path to early funding. ASU has been designated an **Ashoka U Changemaker Campus** three times, most recently renewed in January 2025, reflecting the university's commitment to social innovation.

**Key funding opportunities through Changemaker Central:**

The **Changemaker Challenge** awards up to **$10,000** for ideas that create positive impact in local or global communities. **Changemaker Action Grants** provide up to **$2,000** for social impact projects, startups, and initiatives with a rolling application process. The **Woodside Community Action Grant** offers up to **$1,500** for service-focused projects.

Changemaker Central is student-led and maintains hubs on all four Phoenix metro campuses, with the main location at Memorial Union on the Tempe campus. All ASU students are eligible. Visit changemaker.asu.edu for current application cycles and deadlines.

For education technology ventures specifically, while ASU's EdPlus unit primarily focuses on institutional infrastructure rather than student ventures, the **ASU+GSV Summit** (which ASU co-hosts as the nation's leading education technology summit) provides networking opportunities with EdTech investors and entrepreneurs. Students should also consider **InnovationSpace**, a two-semester transdisciplinary program where teams of five students from design, engineering, business, and sustainability develop products for corporate sponsors—past projects have included healthcare accessibility devices and therapeutic technologies.

## SEED SPOT offers Arizona's premier social impact accelerator

Outside ASU, **SEED SPOT** represents the most accessible and relevant accelerator for students with healthcare or education prototypes focused on social impact. This Phoenix-based nonprofit is ranked among the **Top 20 accelerators worldwide** and notably **takes no equity** from participating ventures.

SEED SPOT's **Community Health Incubator** specifically targets healthcare solutions and includes a **$15,000 grant**. The **Impact Accelerator** is an 8-week program for early-stage social ventures. For students just beginning their entrepreneurial journey, the **2-Day Launch Camp** provides foundational training and costs $250 (sometimes free through microgrants).

Eligibility is deliberately broad: 49% of founders are female, 45% are minority, and the program accepts both for-profit and nonprofit ventures at early stages (even idea-stage). This makes SEED SPOT particularly valuable for students who may not yet have the traction required for other programs.

Location: 515 E Grant St, Phoenix, AZ 85004. Contact: connect@seedspot.org or (602) 456-9944. Website: seedspot.org. The Community Health Incubator runs multiple cohorts annually—check the website for current application deadlines.

## Arizona's healthcare ecosystem offers clinical validation pathways

Beyond ASU, Arizona's healthcare innovation ecosystem provides multiple opportunities for students to access clinical validation and industry connections.

The **Phoenix Bioscience Core (PBC)** is a 30-acre urban bioscience campus in downtown Phoenix housing ASU, NAU, and UofA research facilities. The newly launched **XLR8 PBC Mentorship Program** supports emerging health and life science companies with personalized mentorship. Students based at 850 PBC through HEALab or College of Health Solutions programs have direct access to this ecosystem.

The **Center for Entrepreneurial Innovation (CEI)** at Gateway Community College offers equity-free incubation with wet labs, office space, and specialized programs for medical devices and bio-science. As both ASU and MCCCD are part of Arizona's higher education system, CEI is accessible to ASU students, particularly through the LabForce facility at 850 PBC downtown. Website: ceigateway.com.

**HonorHealth Research and Innovation Institute** operates 300+ active clinical trials and recently opened the HonorHealth/CDW Transformation Center for testing healthcare solutions in simulated environments. While no formal student programs exist, research collaboration opportunities may be available through university partnerships.

For industry exposure and networking, the **Arizona Bioindustry Association (AZBio)** runs the **Student Discovery Zone & Scholarship Competition**—full-time students at Arizona universities can submit research posters and 2-minute videos for scholarship prizes and recognition at AZBio Awards. Deadline: **September 12, 2025** for the 2025 competition. Contact: AdvancingBio@AZBio.org or (480) 779-8101.

## State programs provide additional funding pathways

The **Arizona Commerce Authority** operates several programs relevant to student entrepreneurs, though eligibility requirements vary.

The **Venture Start Program** (offered in partnership with ASU Edson E+I) is a six-session hybrid accelerator that is **free and open to anyone in Arizona**, making it ideal for students. Topics include Business Model Canvas, customer discovery, financial modeling, and pitch preparation. Participants can compete at the Venture Challenge Showcase for a **$10,000 grant** sponsored by GoDaddy. Apply through azcommerce.com/start-up/venture-programs/.

The **Arizona Innovation Challenge** offers minimum **$50,000 in non-dilutive funding** plus three months of customized Entrepreneur-in-Residence support. However, eligibility requires a formed corporate entity (LLC, C-Corp, or S-Corp), 2-29 employees (two must be full-time), and minimum **$5,000 monthly recurring revenue** for the SaaS track. This is aspirational for most hackathon projects but provides a clear target for ventures that achieve product-market fit. The Spring 2026 cohort application timeline is forthcoming.

The **AZ FAST Grant Program** provides up to **$3,000** to help Arizona entrepreneurs compete for SBIR/STTR federal grant proposals. This is particularly relevant for healthcare or education ventures with research-based innovations that could qualify for federal small business research funding.
